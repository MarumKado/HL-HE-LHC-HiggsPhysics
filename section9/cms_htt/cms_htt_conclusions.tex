The HL-LHC projections of the most recent results on searches for neutral 
MSSM Higgs bosons decaying to $\tau$ leptons have been shown,
based on a data set of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$
collected in 2016, 
corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 35.9\fbinv.
The assumed integrated luminosity for the HL-LHC is 3000\fbinv.
In terms of cross section, 
an order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity
is expected for neutral Higgs boson masses above 1 TeV 
since here the current analysis is statistically limited by the 
available integrated luminosity. For lower masses, an improvement of 
approximately a factor of five is expected for realistic
assumptions on the evolution of the systematic uncertainties.
For the MSSM benchmarks,
the sensitivity will reach up to Higgs boson masses
of 2 TeV for values of $\tan \beta$ of 36, 26, and 28  
for the $\mhmodp$, the hMSSM, and the tau-phobic scenarios,
respectively.
