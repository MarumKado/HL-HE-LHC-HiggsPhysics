HL-LHC projections of the most recent results of searches for MSSM Higgs bosons decaying to $\tau$ leptons have been shown 
based on the 2016 dataset corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 35.9\fbinv.
In terms of cross section, 
an order-of-magnitude increase of sensitivity is expected for neutral Higgs boson masses above 1 TeV since here the analysis is statistically limited by the 
available integrated luminosity. For lower masses, an improvement by approximately a factor of five is expected for realistic assumptions on the evolution of 
the systematic uncertainties. For the MSSM benchmarks, the sensitivity will reach up to Higgs boson masses of 2 TeV for values of $\tan \beta$ of 36, 26, and 28  
for the $\mhmodp$, the hMSSM, and the tau-phobic scenario, respectively.
