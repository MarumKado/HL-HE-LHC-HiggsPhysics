Searches for heavy scalars are highly complementary to coupling measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs $h$ as probes of extended Higgs sectors. 
Di-boson search channels $H \to WW$, $ZZ$ probe the parameter space for which the 125 GeV Higgs is not SM-like, 
in combination with Higgs coupling measurements. Both probes suffer suffer a significant loss in  
sensitivity to new physics in the limit of a SM-like 125 GeV Higgs, 
since the couplings $HVV$ ($V = W^{\pm},\,Z$) vanish in such case.
For two-Higgs-doublet-model (2HDM) scenarios, this corresponds to the so-called alignment limit~\cite{Gunion:2002zf},
where searches for heavy scalars through non-standard ``Higgs-to-Higgs"
decay channels~\cite{Coleppa:2014hxa,Dorsch:2014qja,Li:2015lra,Kling:2016opi,Dorsch:2016tab} 
as well as through fermionic decay channels~\cite{Craig:2015jba,Gori:2016zto} become a key avenue to find these new states, 
and are crucial to fully cover the parameter space of 2HDMs.

We focus here on HL-LHC and HE-LHC probes of neutral scalars via ``Higgs-to-Higgs" decays, and briefly discuss also their interplay 
with direct searches of such states in fermionic decay channels. Specifically, we consider a general 2HDM scalar potential with a softly broken 
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry (and no CP violation), given by 
%
\begin{eqnarray}	
\label{2HDM_potential}
V(H_1,H_2) &= &\mu^2_1 \left|H_1\right|^2 + \mu^2_2\left|H_2\right|^2 - \mu^2\left[H_1^{\dagger}H_2+\mathrm{h.c.}\right] 
+\frac{\lambda_1}{2}\left|H_1\right|^4 +\frac{\lambda_2}{2}\left|H_2\right|^4 \nonumber \\
&+& \lambda_3 \left|H_1\right|^2\left|H_2\right|^2
+\lambda_4 \left|H_1^{\dagger}H_2\right|^2+ \frac{\lambda_5}{2}\left[\left(H_1^{\dagger}H_2\right)^2+\mathrm{h.c.}\right]\, . 
\end{eqnarray}
%
Apart from the 125 GeV Higgs $h$, the 2HDM scalar sector includes two neutral states 
$H$ and $A$, respectively CP-even and CP-odd, as well as a charged scalar $H^{\pm}$.
Regarding the couplings of the two doublets $H_{1,2}$ to fermions, we consider  
a Type-I and a Type-II 2HDM scenarios (see e.g.~\cite{} for a review),
with the parameters $t_{\beta} \equiv \mathrm{tan}\,\beta$ and $c_{\beta -\alpha} \equiv \mathrm{cos}\,(\beta-\alpha)$ controlling 
the coupling strength of the various 2HDM scalars to gauge bosons and fermions.

Focusing on the 2HDM neutral scalars, the decay $A \to Z H$ ($H \to Z A$) yields a powerful probe of the 
region $m_A > m_H + m_Z$ ($m_H > m_A + m_Z$)~\cite{Coleppa:2014hxa,Dorsch:2014qja}. 
We first obtain the present 13 TeV LHC limits on the 2HDM parameter space from the 
search $A \to Z H$ ($Z\to \ell\ell$, $H \to b\bar{b}$) by ATLAS with $36.1$ fb$^{-1}$~\cite{Aaboud:2018eoy} (see also~\cite{Khachatryan:2016are,CMS:2016qxc} for 
corresponding searches by CMS), considering in particular the alignment limit $c_{\beta -\alpha} = 0$.
Our signal cross sections and branching fractions are obtained 
respectively with {\sl SusHi}~\cite{Harlander:2012pb} and {\sl 2HDMC}~\cite{Eriksson:2009ws}, and we use the 
publicly available observed 95 $\%$ C.L. signal cross section limits in the ($m_A$, $m_H$) plane from~\cite{Aaboud:2018eoy}.   
In order to derive a sensititivy projection of this search to HL-LHC and HE-LHC with 
$3000$ fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, we first perform a $\sqrt{\mathcal{L}}$ rescaling of the present ATLAS expected 
sensititivy, assuming that the background uncertainties are statistically dominated.
We then perform a further rescaling of the sensitivity from $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV to 
$\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV (HL-LHC) and $\sqrt{s} = 27$ TeV (HE-LHC) under the assumption that the
ratio of acceptance$\times \sigma$ for the SM background for 27 TeV, 14 TeV and 13 TeV are the
same as the ratio of Higgs production cross section\footnote{That is, we assume signal and background increase by the same amount in going from 
13 TeV to 14 TeV, or 13 TeV to 27 TeV. This is a conservative assumption particularly for high masses $m_A$.}. 
The present bounds and projected sensitivities are shown in Figure~\ref{AZH_HL-LHC} in the 
($m_A$, $\mathrm{tan}\beta$) plane for Type I (left) and Type II (right) 2HDM, 
considering respectively $m_A = m_H + 100$ GeV (top) and $m_A = m_H + 200$ GeV (bottom).
We note that, since the limits from~\cite{Aaboud:2018eoy} do not extend beyond 
$m_A = 800$ GeV or go below $m_H = 130$ GeV, our corresponding projections based on those limits cannot 
extend beyond those parameter regions either.

In order to study the interplay of the above searches with heavy scalar searches in fermionic decay modes like $H/A \to \tau\tau$, 
we translate the model-independent HL-LHC and HE-LHC sensitivity projections for $\phi \to \tau\tau$ from section (9.6.3) 
to the $m_{\phi}$, $\mathrm{tan}\beta$ plane (with $\phi = H/A$) of the 2HDM (here assume one scalar at a time? should be a fair assumption if 
$|m_A - m_H| \gg \delta m_{\tau\tau}$, with $\delta m_{\tau\tau}$ the invariant mass resolution of the analysis)
using {\sl SusHi}~\cite{Harlander:2012pb} and {\sl 2HDMC}~\cite{Eriksson:2009ws}, assuming 
$\mathrm{cos}(\beta - \alpha) = 0$.
