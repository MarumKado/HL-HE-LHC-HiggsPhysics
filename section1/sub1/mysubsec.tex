\subsection{Bibliography}
Keep each Section totally selfcontained, with
its own folder(s) for figures, and its own file for
bibliography~\cite{Mangano:2270978}.
Use bibtex format. Please get the bibtex from Inspire, other sources
may generate generate conflicts with the bibliography style file. For
internal notes of the LHC experiments, get the bibtex input from CDS
(the CERN Document Service). Each section must have its own bib
files. These are called \texttt{section.bib}, and should stay in the
folder
\verb|\main/mysection/bib/section.bib}|.
When you create a new section, add the bib file to the string
\begin{verbatim} 
\def\bibfiles{\main/bib/chapter,\main/section1/bib/section,\main/section2/bib/section}
\end{verbatim}
that is included in the main driver, report.tex.
