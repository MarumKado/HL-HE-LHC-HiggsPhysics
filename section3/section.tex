\subsection{Double Higgs measurements and trilinear coupling: experimental prospects}

TO DO: Complete the introduction.

The production of HH pairs through gluon-gluon fusion is considered, with an expected cross-section of 36.69$^{+2.1\%}_{-4.9\%}$ fb at 14 TeV~\cite{HHxsec}.
The NNLOFTapprox is used, for a Higgs boson mass of 125 \UGeV. Scale uncertainties are reported as superscript/subscript. The estimated top quark mass uncertainty of the NNLOFTapprox predictions is also presented, together with PDF and $\alpha_{S}$ uncertainties. PDF uncertainties are estimated within the Born-improved approximation. The calculation is performed in the on-shell top quark mass scheme, and studies of the uncertainty related to the scheme choice are in progress.
