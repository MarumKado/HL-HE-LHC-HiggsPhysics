%\section[L. Cadamuro, E. Petit, M. Riembau]{Di-Higgs production and Higgs self couplings}\label{sec2}

The HL-LHC is expected to be a Higgs boson factory, and the study of the double-Higgs ($HH$) production is one of the key goal of this high-luminosity program. Despite the small production cross-section compared to the single-Higgs boson production, more than 100000 $HH$ pairs should be produced by the HL-LHC per experiment. The trilinear self-interaction of the Higgs boson is described by a with a coupling strength $\lambda_{HHH}  = \frac{m_H^2}{2v^2} $, where $m_H$ is the Higgs boson mass, and $v$ the electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum expectation value. Measurements of the Higgs trilinear interaction would provide constraints on the shape of the Higgs potential close to the minimum. and would allow to verify the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism of the SM.
The existence of an extended scalar sector or the presence of new dynamics at higher scales could modify the Higgs boson self-couplings.
In the following the trilinear self-coupling strength, measured relative to the SM expectation is denoted by $\kappa_{\lambda} = c_{hh} = \lambda = \lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}$

This section describes the prospects for studies of the Higgs boson pair production at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC and is organised as follows: the state-of-the-art NLO computations of the Higgs boson pair production cross sections is shown in Section~\ref{sec:HH_NLO}. Section~\ref{sec:HH_meas_exp} describes the prospect experimental analyses with the ATLAS and CMS experiments with realistic conditions, while Section~\ref{sec:HH_meas_th} concentrates on alternative methods with phenomenology studies. Studies at the HE-LHC are shown in Section~\ref{sec:HH_HE} with both phenomenological and experimental perspectives. Indirect probes of the trilinear couplings are described in Section~\ref{sec:HH_indirect}, using differential cross-section measurements or global fits. Finally Section~\ref{sec:HH_implications} show the implications of the trilinear coupling measurements on b-physics and the electroweak phase transition.

\subsection{Double Higgs measurements and trilinear coupling: experimental prospects}
\label{sec:HH_meas_exp}

The current Run 2 measurements of the Higgs-boson-pair production are performed with approximately 36~$fb^{-1}$ of collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13~\UTeV, combining different decay channels~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-043, Sirunyan:2018two}. 
The ATLAS collaboration reports the combined observed (expected) limit on the non-resonant Higgs-boson-pair production cross-section of 6.7 (10.4) times the SM expectation. The ratio of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its SM expectation is observed (expected) to be constrained at 95\% CL to $-5.0<\kappa_{\lambda}<12.1$ ($-5.8<\kappa_{\lambda}<12.0$). 
The reported combined observed (expected) limit on the non-resonant Higgs-boson-pair production cross-section by the CMS collaboration is 22.2 (12.8) times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. The ratio of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its SM expectation is observed (expected) to be constrained at 95\% CL to $-11.8<\kappa_{\lambda}<18.8$ ($-7.1<\kappa_{\lambda}<13.6$). 

Either those measurements were extrapolated to the centre-of-mass energy of 14~\UTeV and integrated luminosity of 3000~\ifb, either dedicated samples were used. Parametrised functions were used to estimate the response of the upgraded ATLAS and CMS detectors at the HL-LHC. The average number of additional proton-proton interactions (pile-up) per bunch crossing is assumed to be $<\mu>$ = 200.

Only the production of HH pairs through gluon-gluon fusion is considered (the other production mechanisms being more than an order magnitude smaller), with an expected cross-section of 36.69$^{+2.1\%}_{-4.9\%}$ fb at 14 \UTeV as described in Section~\ref{sec:HH_NNLO}. The state of the art NNLO/NNLL calculation with finite top mass effects included at NLO in QCD is used, for a Higgs boson mass of 125 \UGeV. Scale uncertainties are reported as superscript/subscript. The estimated top quark mass uncertainty of the NNLOFTapprox predictions is also computed, together with PDF and $\alpha_{S}$ uncertainties. PDF uncertainties are estimated within the Born-improved approximation. The calculation is performed in the on-shell top quark mass scheme.
The Feynman diagram which exhibits a \lHHH\ dependence interferes destructively with the box diagram that is independent of \lHHH, thus a small increase in the value of \lHHH decreases the expected HH production cross section, and modifies the distributions of event kinematics.

\subsection{Indirect probes}
\label{sec:HH_indirect}

In this section we discuss the possibility of indirectly extract information on the trilinear self interaction of the Higgs boson via precise measurements of single-Higgs production~\cite{McCullough:2013rea,Gorbahn:2016uoy,Degrassi:2016wml,Bizon:2016wgr,DiVita:2017eyz,Barklow:2017awn,Maltoni:2017ims,DiVita:2017vrr,Maltoni:2018ttu} at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC. This strategy is complementary to the direct measurement via double-Higgs production, which already at leading order,~i.e.~at one loop in the case of $gg \to HH$, depends on the trilinear Higgs self interaction. In the case of single-Higgs production, on the contrary, the Higgs self interactions enter only via one-loop corrections, i.e., at the two-loop level for the gluon-fusion ($ggF$) production mode. The effects of modified Higgs self interactions are therefore generically much smaller, but for single-Higgs production processes the precision of the experimental measurements is and will be much better than for double-Higgs production. This, and the fact that for single-Higgs production many different final states and both inclusive as well as  differential measurements are possible will lead to competitive indirect determinations of the trilinear Higgs self coupling. In \cite{Degrassi:2017ucl,Kribs:2017znd} also electroweak precision observables have been considered to this purpose.

\subsection{Summary}

A measurement of the Higgs self-coupling is not only one of the last corners of the SM to be experimentally tested, but also a particularly interesting one due to its important implications on our knowledge of the Higgs potential, and the direct implications on the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking, the stability of our universe's vacuum and the matter-antimatter asymmetry. In this chapter we presented a study on the capabilities of the HL-LHC and HE-LHC programs to elucidate on these fundamental questions.

The Higgs self-coupling appears at tree level in the production of Higgs boson pairs. The SM cross section for $pp\to \HH$ computed at full NLO precision is $32.88^{13.5\%}_{-12.5\%}\,\text{fb}$ at $\sqrt{s}=14\,\text{\UTeV}$ and $127.7^{11.5\%}_{-10.4\%}\,\text{fb}$ at $\sqrt{s}=27\,\text{\UTeV}$, a factor 4 increase between the two centre of mass energies. The full NLO dependence on the trilinear coupling has been computed and illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:sigmatot} for selected coupling strength values. The NLO cross section has been computed for a set of benchmark points in the nonlinear EFT formalism as reported in Table~\ref{sigmatot}.

The ATLAS projections at HL-LHC for the $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$, $b\bar{b}\tau\bar{\tau}$ and $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ decay modes are summarised in Fig.~\ref{fig:ATLAS_HH_comb}. Considering the systematic uncertainties, the $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ channel gives the constraints $-2.3\leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 6.4$ at 68\% CL; the  $b\bar{b}\tau\bar{\tau}$ allows to resolve the region between the two minima giving $0.1\leq \kappa_\lambda\leq 2.3 \cup 5.7\leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 7.8$; and the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ gives the best precision with the interval $-0.2 \leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 2.5$.

The CMS projections include, on top of the channels studied by ATLAS, the decays $b\bar{b}\ell\nu\ell\nu$ and $b\bar{b}\ell\ell\ell\ell$, with projected constraints $-1.7\leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 9.6$ and $-1.8\leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 8.1$ respectively. For the other channels, the projected reach is $-0.6\leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 7.2$ for $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$, $-0.2\leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 3.2 \cup 5.2\leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 7.7$ for  $b\bar{b}\tau\bar{\tau}$ and $0.3\leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 2.3$ for $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$.

Experiments provide a combination of the projections, summarised in Fig~\ref{fig:comb_HH_experiment} and Fig.~\ref{fig:comb_HH}. A combined significance of $4\sigma$ for the SM \HH signal is predicted.
The 68\% CL intervals are $0.52\leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 1.5$ and $0.57\leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 1.5$ with and without systematic uncertainties respectively. The second minimum is excluded at 99.4\% CL, and the hypothesis corresponding to the absence of self-coupling  ($\kappa_\lambda=0$) is excluded at the 95\% CL.

Further improvements in the analysis are proposed. The Topness and Higgsness variables can further increase the signal sensitivity for $\HH$ production, and improved multivariate methods are proposed to improve the background discrimination in the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ channel.

For the future HE-LHC upgrade, ATLAS presented projections for the $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ and $b\bar{b}\tau\bar{\tau}$ channels, with an expected sensitivity of around 10\%-20\% on $\kappa_\lambda$.

A complementary strategy to extract the trilinear from the LHC data consists in considering NLO corrections to single Higgs observables that depend on the self-coupling. This dependence has been computed and is presented in Tables~\ref{c1s},\ref{tab:c1-xs_13},\ref{tab:c1-xs_27},\ref{c1g}. The CMS experiment has provided a first analysis based on this strategy using $t\bar{t}\text{H}$ production with the decay $\text{H}\to \gamma\gamma$, with a resulting constraint of $-2\leq \kappa_\lambda\leq 5.5$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:ttHdiff_CMS_klambda_scan}. Considering that other parameters may affect single Higgs process, this has been studied under the perspective of a global fit, presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:hllhcchi2} estimating a $-3\leq \kappa_\lambda \leq 3$ reach at 68\% CL, complementing the constraints from double Higgs boson production. At HE-LHC, the projections are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:helhcchi2}.

Implications of the $\HH$ measurements involve a wide variety of models. We present the interpretation within a flavour model which implies large Yukawa couplings for the light quarks, modifying the di-Higgs invariant mass distribution non-trivially, see Fig.~\ref{fig:hhflavourxsanddistr}. Also, Higgs boson pair production plays a crucial role on understanding the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking phase transition, which might imply potentially observable effects if there are new states modifying the potential so that the matter-antimatter asymmetry can be explained via electroweak baryogenesis.
