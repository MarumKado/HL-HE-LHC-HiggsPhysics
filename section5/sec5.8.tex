A detailed study of the impact of the phenomenon of interference between the signal process $gg \rightarrow H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ and its irreducible background process $gg \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ has been made in \cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-009}. It will be summarized below.

All the results from \cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-009} have been made with simulated data for the $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV dataset. A full-fledge extrapolation to higher center of mass energies remains to be done. However, the two processes that interfere together, are induced by the same initial state and are at a similar mass scale. All the results are based on a difference between results simulated data where the interference have been implemented in the simulation, and simulated data where it is not. In the following, we will therefore consider that any increase of the cross-section with respect to $\sqrt{s}$ will cancel out in the difference.

The main goal of \cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-009} was the achievement of a robust e
