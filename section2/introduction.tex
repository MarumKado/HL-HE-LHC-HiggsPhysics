The large number of events expected in almost all Higgs boson measurement channels for the HL-LHC and HE-LHC will allow very precise measurements of Higgs boson cross section and coupling properties. In many channels, the expected overall statistical, experimental and theoretical uncertainties will be similar in size. Therefore, a close interaction between the experimental and theory communities will be needed in order to reach the best measurements.

Section~\ref{sec:2_HXSWG1} provides an overview of theoretical predictions for Higgs boson production at 14 and 27~\UTeV\ and of the uncertainties that are expected to be reached by the time of the final HL-LHC and HE-LHC measurements. 
These prediction are used as input to the studies of the sensitivity of ATLAS and CMS Higgs boson cross section and coupling measurements in individual channels that are summarized in Section~\ref{sec:2:channels} and for the expectations for differential cross section measurements presented in Section~\ref{sec:2:fiducial}.
Section~\ref{sec:2:top} puts emphasis on all measurements related to the top Yukawa coupling, as this is the largest Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model with a value close to unity and hence of special interest in understanding the Higgs mechanism and its relation to fermions (TO EDIT: shall we expand this argument?).
The combination of the expected measurements in ATLAS and CMS are presented in Section~\ref{sec:2:exp_combination} together with an interpretation in the kappa-model~\cite{LHCHiggsCrossSectionWorkingGroup:2012nn,Heinemeyer:2013tqa}.
