\subsubsection{$H \to \tau^{+}\tau^{-}$}

%\end{center}
The measurement of the Higgs boson  in the $H \to \tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ channel considers the leptonic ($\tau_{lep}$) and the hadronic ($\tau_{had}$) decays of the $\tau$ lepton. Three subs-channels ($\tau_{lep}\tau_{lep}$, $\tau_{lep}\tau_{had}$ and $\tau_{had}\tau_{had}$) are defined by requirements on the number of hadronically decaying $\tau$-leptons candidates and leptons (electrons or muons) in the event.
Candidate events are divided into categories using kinematic properties to target cases in which the Higgs boson is produced with a  boost ($\pT > 100$ GeV), primarily from gluon  fusion, and cases primarily produced from vector boson fusion, in which the Higgs boson is produced with two jets separated in pseudo-rapidity. Additional requirements are employed to discriminate signal from background. One of the most important variable is the mass of the $\tau\tau$ system, calculated in ATLAS with the Missing Mass Calculator \cite{Elagin:2010aw}.
The normalization of the dominant backgrounds ($Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$, $t\bar{t}$, Fake-$\tau_{had}$) is determined using dedicated control regions, or extracted directly in each signal region ($Z\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, the dominant and irreducible background).  More details on the analysis methods can be found in the most recent measurements in the  $H \to \tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ channels published by ATLAS \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-021} and CMS \cite{Sirunyan:2017khh}.

%dataset of the extrapolation
The studies presented here are performed based on a previous analysis, in which the ATLAS Collaboration analyzed the 2015/2016 proton-proton collision dataset collected at $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\UTeV$, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1\fbinv \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-021}. 
%results
The measurements of the cross sections for the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes are dominated by systematic uncertainties, as can be seen in  Table \ref{tab:htt_proj}, which  lists the total expected uncertainties on the cross sections normalised to their SM values as well as  the different contributions from different types of uncertainties. 
The dominant contributions, the experimental and background modelling errors, are due to uncertainties on jet calibration and resolution, on the reconstruction of the $E_{T}^{miss}$, and on the determination of the background normalization from signal and control regions.
These results are compared to the SM prediction in Figure \ref{fig:htt_proj}; the SM uncertainties are divided by two compared to their current values, which approximately corresponds to the scaling expected from S2  scenario. The figure shows that at the HL-LHC the measurement will reach a level of precision which is  similar to the theory predictions. These systematic uncertainties are dominated by the theoretical errors on the signal acceptance for the gluon fusion measurement both for S1 and S2. In the measurement of the vector boson fusion cross section, the effects of the experimental errors and uncertainties on the background modelling become more relevant, expecially in S2.

%dataset of the extrapolation
The measurement of the Higgs boson  in the $H \to b\bar{b}$ channel presented here considers the Higgs boson production in assoculation with a vector boson ($V=W/Z$). 
Searches for the  $H \to b\bar{b}$  in association with a vector boson drove the recent observation  of this decay mode reported by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations \cite{Aaboud:2018zhk,Sirunyan:2018kst}.
The analyses make use of leptonic decays of the vector boson for triggering and to reduce the multi-jet background: the final states
of the $\vh$ system covered in the analyses always contain two b-jets and either zero, one or two electrons or muons. Both leptons are required to have the same flavour in the two lepton selection.
%backgrounds
Major backgrounds arising from SM production of vector boson plus heavy- or light-flavour jets, in addition to $t\bar{t}$ production, are 
controlled and constrained via dedicated control regions. The  b-jet energy resolution is improved by using multivariate energy regression techniques (CMS), or sequential corrections (ATLAS), and a boosted decision tree is used to improve the discrimination 
between signal and background. The distribution of this multivariate discriminator is used as the discriminating
variable in the signal extraction fit. 

The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have both recently reported the observation of the $H \to b\bar{b}$ decay \cite{Aaboud:2018zhk,Sirunyan:2018kst}.
The studies presented here are performed by extrapolating this most recent ATLAS $H \to b\bar{b}$ measurements using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 78.9 \fbinv, and by extrapolating a previous analysis by the CMS Collaboration. In this previous analysis evidence for the$H \to b\bar{b}$ decay in the $\text{VH}$ production mode was reported using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9\fbinv \cite{HIG16044}.

%The signal strength observed in the CMS analysis is 
%$\mu_{\text{VHbb}} = 1.19^{+0.21}_{-0.20}\text{ (stat) }^{+0.34}_{-0.32}\text{ (syst) }$. The projected uncertainties on the signal strength reported here %assume $\mu_{\text{vHbb}} = 1$.

Figure \ref{fig:vhbb_proj_bars} shows the extrapolation of the signal strength uncertainty per-channel (CMS) and per-production mode (ATLAS). The details of the contributions of different sources of uncertainty in scenarios S1 and S2 for the projection of the ATLAS and CMS analyses are shown in Table~\ref{tab:vhbb_uncertbreakdown}.
%These results are for the projection of the CMS analysis.
The large improvement, by a factor 2.5--3, in the uncertainty of the measurement for the $WH$ (1-lepton channel) compared to the Run-2 results (around 45\%) is caused by the integrated luminosity scaling of the uncertainty in the modelling of the $W$ boson $\pT$ distribution for both the collaborations, being the dominant uncertainty in scenario S1.

Both in scenario S1 and S2 the largest component of the systematic uncertainty is theoretical. This arises from the uncertainty in the gluon-induced $ZH$ ($gg\to ZH$) production cross section due to QCD scale variations. The $gg\to ZH$ process contributes a small fraction of the total $ZH$ process. Despite this, the uncertainty in the production cross section for this process due to QCD scale variations  becomes dominant because it is very large: 25\% for the $gg\to ZH$ process, compared to approximately 0.7\% for the $qq\to ZH$ process \cite{deFlorian:2016spz}. The theoretical uncertainties on the $gg\to ZH$ production are reduced to 15\% in the S2.
An important contribution to the uncertainties are due to category-acceptance uncertainties in the dominant $Z+bb$ and $W+bb$ backgrounds due to QCD scale variations, as well as the uncertainty in the $qq\to ZH$ and $WH$ production
cross section due to QCD scale variations. In extrapolation to the scenario S2 done by the CMS Collaboration, these four most important uncertainties contribute 1.6\%, 1.5\%, 1.3\% and 1.2\% (absolute) to
the total uncertainty of 5.1\%, respectively. To improve the precision of the measurement it is therefore important to improve these theoretical uncertainties.


In the future, and at the HL-LHC in particular, the b-tagging efficiency may change. The conditions could worsen the efficiency, but
at the same time new detectors and new techniques could also lead to an improvement in the b-tagging efficiency. 
The effect of changes in b-tagging efficiency on the overall signal strength uncertainty has been evaluated by the CMS collaboration. 
Figure \ref{fig:vhbb_btageff} shows the results of the projection  assuming various reductions and improvements in the b-tagging efficiency relative to the performance of the b-tagging algorithm used in the analysis.
A 10\% improvement in the b-tagging efficiency leads to a relative improvement in the signal strength uncertainty of up to 6\%.

\subsubsection{$H \to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$}
%\begin{center}

%\end{center}
The  $H \to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ analyses search for a narrow peak in the dimuon invariant mass over a smooth background which is dominated by the irreducible $Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ background. Events must have two opposite-charge muons passing loose quality selections to retain as much signal as possible. 
The overall sensitivity to this decay mode is improved by categorizing the selected events into two set of signal regions which separate the signal events produced in vector boson fusion  (catheterized by the presence of jets) from the rest (produced in gluon fusion). These two set of signal regions are further divided in sub-categories based on multivariate classifiers, or based on signal purity and muon momemtum resolution. More details on the analysis methods can be found in the most recent searches of the  $H \to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ channels published by ATLAS \cite{Aaboud:2017ojs} and CMS \cite{HIG-17-019}.  

The studies presented here are performed based on a previous analysis, in which the ATLAS Collaboration analyzed the 2015-2017 proton-proton collision dataset collected at $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\UTeV$, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 79.8\fbinv \cite{Aaboud:2017ojs}. 
In addition to the standard extrapolation procedure, the di-muon signal widths are reduced  by 15-30\% thanks the improvements expected from the performance of the tracker system upgrade ITk\cite{Collaboration:2285585}.
In this analysis, the $Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ background is fully determined by data, and it is modelled by fitting the di-muon invariant mass $m_{\mu\mu}$ distribution in each category using a Breit-Wigner function convolved with a gaussian summed to a smooth function.

The results of the Run-2 analysis with 79.8 fb$^{-1}$ of data at $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\UTeV$ are compared to the results of 
HL-LHC with 3000\fbinv of data at s $\sqrt{s} = 14\,\UTeV$ in Table \ref{tab:hmumu_proj}.

In both the S1 and S2 scenarios, the analysis is limited by the statistical uncertainty, while the leading systematic uncertainty are the bias introduced by the choice of the function describing the background (spurious signal uncertainty), and the uncertainties on the modelling of the signal (their reduction in S2 contributes to an overall improvement of 10\% on the precision of the measurement).

%dataset of the extrapolation
The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have both reported the observation of the $\text{H}\to\text{bb}$ decay \cite{Aaboud:2018zhk,Sirunyan:2018kst}.
The studies presented here are performed by extrapolating the most recent ATLAS $\text{H}\to\text{bb}$ measurements using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 78.9 \fbinv, and by extrapolating a previous analysis by the CMS Collaboration. In this previous analysis evidence for the $\text{H}\to\text{bb}$ decay in the $\text{VH}$ production mode was reported using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9\fbinv \cite{HIG16044}. 

%channels
The analyses make use of leptonic decays of the vector boson which is produced in association with the Higgs boson. The final states
of the $\vh$ system covered in the analyses always contain two b-jets and either zero, one or two electrons or muons. Both leptons are required to have the same flavour in the two lepton selection.
%backgrounds
Major backgrounds arising from SM production of vector boson plus heavy- or light-flavour jets, in addition to \ttbar production, are 
controlled and constrained via dedicated control regions. Multivariate energy regression techniques are used to improve the b-jet energy resolution, and a boosted decision tree is used to improve the discrimination 
between signal and background. The distribution of this multivariate discriminator is used as the discriminating
variable in the signal extraction fit. 
%results
The signal strength observed in the CMS analysis is 
$\mu_{\text{VHbb}} = 1.19^{+0.21}_{-0.20}\text{ (stat) }^{+0.34}_{-0.32}\text{ (syst) }$. The projected uncertainties on the signal strength reported here assume $\mu_{\text{vHbb}} = 1$.

Figure \ref{fig:vhbb_proj_bars} shows the per-channel signal strength uncertainty as well as the uncertainty on the overall signal strength, showing results for all three scenarios described above. These results are for the projection of the CMS analysis.
The large improvement in the signal strength uncertainty for the 1-lepton channel, which is most sensitive to the WH production
mode, is caused by the integrated luminosity scaling of an uncertainty in the modelling of the $\PW$ boson $\pT$ distribution. This uncertainty dominates this channel
in scenario S1.

\label{fig:vhbb_proj_bars}
\end{figure}

The contributions of different sources of uncertainty in scenarios S1 and S2 for the projection of the CMS analysis are shown in Table~\ref{tab:vhbb_uncertbreakdown}.
Both in scenario S1 and S2 the largest component of the systematic uncertainty is theoretical. This arises from the uncertainty in the gluon-induced $\zh$ ($\ggZH$) production cross section due to QCD scale variations. The $\ggZH$ process contributes a small fraction of the total $\zh$ process. Despite this, the uncertainty in the production cross section for this process due to QCD scale variations 
becomes dominant because it is very large: 25\% for the ggZH process, compared to approximately 4\% for the ZH process \cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.
The next most important uncertainties are category-acceptance uncertainties in the dominant Z+bb and W+bb backgrounds due to QCD scale variations, as well as the uncertainty in the ZH and WH production
cross section due to QCD scale variations. In scenario S2 these four most important uncertainties contribute 1.6\%, 1.5\%, 1.3\% and 1.2\% (absolute) to
the total uncertainty of 5.1\%, respectively. To improve the precision of the measurement it is therefore important to improve these theoretical uncertainties.

The signal theory uncertainty is further split into inclusive and acceptance parts, and the contributions of the b-tagging and JES/JER uncertainties to the experimental component are also given.}

In the future, and at the HL-LHC in particular, the b-tagging efficiency may change. The conditions could worsen the efficiency, but
at the same time new detectors and new techniques could also lead to an improvement in the b-tagging efficiency. 
The effect of changes in b-tagging efficiency on the overall signal strength uncertainty is evaluated. Changes in the b-tagging
efficiency are emulated by scaling the rates of processes with a single b-tag by the change in b-tagging efficiency, and scaling the 
rates of processes with two b-tags by the change in b-tagging efficiency squared. The modifications are applied only to the efficiency to select genuine b-jets; the mistagging rates for light quark and gluon jets remain unchanged.

Figure \ref{fig:vhbb_btageff} shows the results of the projection of the CMS analysis assuming various reductions and improvements in the b-tagging efficiency relative to the performance of the b-tagging algorithm used in the analysis.
A 10\% improvement in the b-tagging efficiency leads to a relative improvement in the signal strength uncertainty of up to 6\%. The improvements on the signal strength precision are limited because the uncertainty is dominated by theoretical sources. When neglecting inclusive signal theory uncertainties this improvement becomes up to 8\%.
