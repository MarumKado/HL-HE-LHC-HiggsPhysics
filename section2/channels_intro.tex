\subsubsection{Extrapolation assumptions}
\label{sec:HiggsExtrapAss}

The results presented in this Section are based on the extrapolation to an expected integrated luminosity of 3000\,$\ifb$ at $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV of the corresponding ATLAS and CMS Run-2 results. For some of the Higgs decay final states (ATLAS: $WW^*$, $Z\gamma$, $t\bar{t}H$, $\tau\tau$; CMS: ...) the extrapolation is performed on results obtained with the 2015-2016 36\,$\ifb$ datasets; the remaining final state analyses (ATLAS: $\gamma\gamma$, $ZZ^*$, $b\bar{b}$ and $\mu\mu$; CMS: ...) use the results based on the 2015+2016+2017 80\,$\ifb$ data samples. The starting points of the extrapolated results are measurements based on datasets of size $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ of the expected HL-LHC integrated luminosity. The extrapolations are in this respect very limited with respect to the potential reach of the real HL-LHC analyses, which large statistics will allow to probe corners of the phase space inaccessible at the LHC Run-2.

In addition to the increase in integrated luminosity, the extrapolations account for the increase of signal and background cross-sections from $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV to 14 TeV.  The signal yields have been scaled according to the Higgs boson production cross sections values at 13 and 14 TeV, as reported in Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}. The background yields have been scaled according to the parton luminosity ratio between 13 and 14 TeV, as reported in Ref.~\cite{Heinemeyer:2013tqa}, by taking into account whether the background process is predominantly quark pair or gluon pair initiated.

Object reconstruction efficiencies, resolutions and fake rates are assumed to be similar in the Run-2 and HL-LHC environments, based on the assumption that ATLAS and CMS upgraded detectors will compensate for the at HL-LHC higher pile-up environment.
%% Experimental uncertainties related to object reconstructions are reduced, neglected or kept untouched depending on the their sources.
For the systematic uncertainties which include experimental, signal and background components, two scenarios have been considered.
The first scenario (S1) assumes the same values as those used in the published Run-2 analyses.
The second scenario (S2) implements a reduction of the systematic uncertainties according to the improvements expected to be reached at the end of HL-LHC program in twenty years from now: the correction factors follow the recommendations from Ref.~\cite{HLHELHCCommonSystematics}.
Some systematics uncertainties are specifically treated in the individual analysis, and will be discussed in each dedicated section.
%
In all analyses, the theory uncertainties for signal and background are generally halved, except where more precise extrapolated values have been provided.
The uncertainty on the luminosity is set to 1\%.
The uncertainty related to Monte Carlo samples statistics is assumed to be negligible.
%% In the relevant analyses, the spurious signal uncertainty, accounting for backgroundfunctional mismodelling, is also assumed to become negligible.

The extrapolated results are generally limited by systematic uncertainties. It is worth noting that, despite all efforts to design proper projections, the values of the systematic uncertainties of the Run-2 analyses cannot fully account for the HL-LHC conditions and process understanding. In this sense, they are to be considered an approximation. Future analyses will exploit and gain sensitivity from phase space regions that are not accessible yet, or use analysis techniques that reduce the impact of systematic uncertainties.

In the following, all analyses segment the selected events according to the objects campaigning the main Higgs decay products and their topology, in order to maximize the sensitivity to the main Higgs production modes ($ggH+b\bar{b}H$, VBF, $VH$ = $qqZH+ggZH+WH$ and top = $t\bar{t}H+tH$)  and to reduce the uncertainties on the respective cross sections. Details on how this segmentation is performed, and on the event selection and categorisation in the various analyses, are found in the Run-2 analysis references quoted in each section.
