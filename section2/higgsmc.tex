Monte Carlo's for Higgs Physics.

High-Lumi and High-energy

General purpose Monte Carlo's 
Total and differential cross section calculators
Dedicated MC's 

What are the improvements that are foreseen in the coming years that could change the field. Where the most of the results can be expected? For what? NNLO+PS? 

Collecting references for MINLO, Sherpa so that people can find where to look. 

Table?

Instead of showing an actual plot, we show a mock-plot where
the various features which are most important are summarized. 

What can we say it would be needed and in the ball park of the feasible stuff. Examples for main channels.

\begin{itemize}
\item approx rapidity at N3LO for gluon-fusion
\item N3LO VBF is available inclusive => exclusive?
\item NNLO+NLL as the next revolution for ggH, VH, VBF,...
\item top / bottom mass effects
\end{itemize}

Organise it in terms of methods and developments and then physics channels.
