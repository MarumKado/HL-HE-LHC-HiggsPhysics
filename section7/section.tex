\asubsection{Introduction}

In this section we cover the current status and future prospects for measuring the different Higgs couplings to fermions, these go under the generic name of ``Higgs and Flavor". 
The Higgs mechanism of the SM predict that the Yukawa couplings are proportional to the fermion mass and CP conserving, or more precisely 
%
\begin{align}
    y^{\rm SM}_f = \sqrt{2} m_f / v \, ,
\end{align}
%
where the tree-level flavor changing couplings are zero.  Currently,
only the third generation Yukawa couplings were directly measured and
found to be in agreement with the SM prediction, see
Refs.~\cite{Aad:2015vsa,Aaboud:2018pen,Sirunyan:2018kst,Aaboud:2018zhk,
  Aaboud:2017jvq,Aaboud:2018urx,Sirunyan:2018shy} for recent results
on $h\tau\bar{\tau}$, $h b\bar{b}$ and $h \bar{t} t$.  However, for
the Higgs coupling to first and second generations there are only
upper bounds
~\cite{Aaboud:2018fhh,Aaboud:2017ojs,Perez:2015aoa,Altmannshofer:2015qra,
  Kagan:2014ila}.

Below, we adapt the generalised $\kappa$ framework to describe deviations of the Higgs couplings from their SM values due to new physics~(NP).
In particular, we define 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:L_eff}
\begin{split}
	\mathcal{L}_{\rm eff} &= -\kappa_{f_i} \frac{m_{f_i}}{v} h \bar f_i f_i + i \tilde \kappa_{f_i} \frac{m_{f_i}}{v} h \bar f_i \gamma_5 f_i  
	- \left[\left( \kappa_{f_i f_j} + i \tilde \kappa_{f_i f_j} \right) h \bar f_L^i f_R^j +{\rm h.c.}\right]_{i\neq j}, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
where a sum over fermion type $f=u,d,\ell$ and generations $i,j=1,2,3$ is implied.
The first two terms are flavour-diagonal with the first term CP-conserving and
the second CP-violating.  The terms in square brackets are flavour
violating. The real (imaginary) part of the coefficient is CP
conserving (violating). In the SM, we have $\kappa_{f_i}=1$ while $\tilde
\kappa_{f_i}=\kappa_{{f_i}{f_j}}=\tilde \kappa_{{f_i}{f_j}}=0$.

The different Higgs Yukawa couplings can be probed by direct and
indirect methods.  Direct methods include $t\bar{t}h$ (for
top~\cite{Aaboud:2017jvq,Aaboud:2018urx,Sirunyan:2018shy}), $Vh, h\to
b\bar{b}, c\bar{c} $~(for
bottom~\cite{Aaboud:2018zhk,Sirunyan:2018kst} and
charm~\cite{Aaboud:2018fhh}), $h\to \ell^+ \ell^-$ (for
leptons~\cite{Aaboud:2018pen,Aaboud:2017ojs,Aad:2015vsa}) and
exclusive decays for photon and vector
meson~\cite{Aad:2015sda,Khachatryan:2015lga,Aaboud:2018txb,Aaboud:2017xnb}
(for light quarks).  In addition, the upper bound on the Higgs total
width from $t\to ZZ^*$ and $h\to\gamma\gamma$ signal shapes is an
unavoidable constraint on the rates to any light
particles~\cite{Perez:2015aoa}.  In principle, one can use the
off-shell Higgs width measurement~\cite{Englert:2014aca,Englert:2014ffa},
but it involves assumptions about the ratio between off-shell and
on-shell Higgs productions.  In addition, there are several indirect
probes of the different Higgs Yukawa couplings, such as kinematic
distributions~\cite{Soreq:2016rae,Bishara:2016jga}.  A global fit of
the Higgs data also provides a bound on the different Yukawa via the
bound on the non SM decays of the Higgs (up to small effects on the
Higgs production,
see~\cite{Delaunay:2013pja,Kagan:2014ila,Perez:2015aoa}), however,
this bound is subject to different assumptions.




The Higgs production and decay signal strengths from the CMS collaboration~\cite{Sirunyan:2018koj} and from ATLAS for $h\to c\bar{c}$~\cite{Aaboud:2018fhh} (most recent at the time of writing) from a global fit which includes the direct observation of $t\bar t h$ production are
\begin{align}
    \mu^{ttH} &= 1.18^{+0.30}_{-0.27}\, ,\qquad \mu^{bb}=1.12^{+0.29}_{-0.29}\, , \qquad
    \mu^{cc} < 105 \, , \nonumber\\ \mu^{\tau\tau} &= 1.20^{+0.26}_{-0.24}\, ,\qquad   \mu^{\mu\mu}=0.68^{+1.25}_{-1.24}\,.
\end{align}
In terms of modifications of the flavor-diagonal and CP-conserving Yukawas,  the best fit values are
\begin{align}
\label{eq:kappalimits}
    \kappa_t &= 1.11^{+0.12}_{-0.10}, & \kappa_b &= -1.10^{+0.33}_{-0.23},\nonumber\\
    \kappa_\tau &= 1.01^{+0.16}_{-0.20}, & \kappa_\mu &= 0.79^{+0.58}_{-0.79}.
\end{align}
See also \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-15-002,CMS-PAS-HIG-17-031}.
The light quarks $u$, $d$, and $s$ and the charm Yukawa can be constrained from a global fit of Higgs data and precision EW measurements at LEP. Floating all couplings in the fit results in the following upper bounds~ \cite{Perez:2015aoa,Kagan:2014ila},
\begin{align}
\kappa_u&<3.4 \cdot 10^{3},  &\kappa_d&<1.7 \cdot 10^3, &\kappa_s&< 42, & \kappa_c \lesssim 6.2\nonumber.
\end{align}
While for the electron Yukawa, the upper bound on $\mbox{BR}(h\to e^+e^-)$ at the LHC translates to an upper bound, $|\kappa_e|<611$~\cite{Khachatryan:2014aep,Altmannshofer:2015qra}. And for future prospects, see~\cite{Perez:2015lra,Brivio:2015fxa,Koenig:2015pha,Aad:2015sda,Bodwin:2014bpa,Bodwin:2013gca}.

The upper bounds on $\kappa_{c,s,d,u}$ roughly
correspond to the size of the SM bottom Yukawa coupling and are thus much bigger than the corresponding SM Yukawa couplings. The upper bounds can be saturated only if one allows for large cancellations between the
contribution to fermion masses from the Higgs VEV and an equally large
but opposite in sign contribution from NP. We will show that in models
of NP motivated by the hierarchy problem, the effects of NP are
generically well below these bounds. A summary of the projected limits on $\kappa_{c,s,d,u}$ is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:sec7:summary} using the methods outlined in this section: exclusive decays of the Higgs, fits of differential cross-sections, constraints from the total Higgs width assuming a value of $200~\mathrm{\UMeV}$, a global fit of Higgs production cross-sections, and direct searches for a $c\bar{c}$ final state.

    \caption{Summary of the projected HL-LHC limits on the light quark Yukawa couplings, including charm.}
    \label{fig:sec7:summary}
\end{figure}

The CP-violating flavour-diagonal Yukawa couplings, $\tilde \kappa_{f_i}$,
are well constrained from bounds on the electric dipole moments~(EDMs)
\cite{Brod:2013cka,Chien:2015xha,Altmannshofer:2015qra,Brod:2018pli} under the assumption of no 
cancellation with other contributions to EDMs beyond the Higgs contributions.
For the electron Yukawa, the latest ACME measurement~\cite{Baron:2013eja,Andreev:2018ayy} results into an upper bound of $\tilde\kappa_e<1.9\times 10^{-3}$~\cite{Altmannshofer:2015qra}. Whereas for the bottom and charm Yukawas, the strongest limits come from the neutron EDM~\cite{Brod:2018pli}. Using the NLO QCD theoretical prediction, this translates into the upper bounds $\tilde\kappa_b<5$ and $\tilde\kappa_c<21$ when theory errors are taken into account.
For the light quark CPV Yukawas, measurement of the Mercury EDM places a strong bound on the up and down Yukawas of $\tilde\kappa_u<0.1$ and $\tilde\kappa_d<0.05$~\cite{Brod:2018xyz} (no theory errors) while the neutron EDM measurement gives a weaker constraint on the strange quark Yukawa of $\tilde\kappa_s<3.1$~\cite{Brod:2018xyz} (no theory errors).


The flavour violating Yukawa couplings are well constrained by the low-energy
flavour-changing neutral current measurements
\cite{Harnik:2012pb,Blankenburg:2012ex,Gorbahn:2014sha}. A notable
exception are the flavour-violating couplings involving a tau lepton. The
strongest constraints on $\kappa_{\tau\mu}, \kappa_{\mu\tau},
\kappa_{\tau e}, \kappa_{e \tau}$ are thus from direct searches of flavour-violating Higgs decays at
the LHC \cite{Sirunyan:2017xzt,Aad:2016blu}.
Finally, the LHC can also set bounds on rare FCNC top decays involving a Higgs~\cite{Aaboud:2017mfd,Khachatryan:2016atv,Aad:2015pja,Aad:2014dya}. The strongest current bound, for example, is $\sqrt{|\kappa_{ct}|^2+|\kappa_{tc}|^2}<0.06$ at 95\%CL where the latest ATLAS bound was converted to a bound on the Yukawa modifier at leading order.


\asubsection[F. Bishara]{New Physics benchmarks for modified Higgs couplings}

Here we review the expected sizes of $\kappa_{f_i}$ in popular models of weak scale NP models, some of them motivated by the hierarchy problem. 
Tables~\ref{tab:upyukawa}, ~\ref{tab:downyukawa},
and~\ref{tab:leptyukawa}, adapted from
\cite{Bishara:2015cha,Dery:2014kxa,Dery:2013aba,Dery:2013rta,Bauer:2015kzy},
summarise the predictions for the effective Yukawa couplings,
$\kappa_f$, in the Standard Model, multi-Higgs-doublet models
(MHDM) with natural flavour conservation (NFC)~\cite{Glashow:1976nt,
  Paschos:1976ay}, a ``flavourful'' two-Higgs-doublet model beyond NFC
(F2HDM)~\cite{Altmannshofer:2015esa, Altmannshofer:2016zrn, 
Altmannshofer:2017uvs, Altmannshofer:2018bch} the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) at tree level, 
a single Higgs doublet with
a Froggat-Nielsen mechanism (FN)~\cite{Froggatt:1978nt}, the
Giudice-Lebedev model of quark masses modified to 2HDM
(GL2)~\cite{Giudice:2008uua}, NP models with minimal flavour violation
(MFV)~\cite{D'Ambrosio:2002ex}, Randall-Sundrum models
(RS)~\cite{Randall:1999ee}, and models with a composite Higgs where
Higgs is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB)~\cite{Dugan:1984hq,
  Georgi:1984ef, Kaplan:1983sm, Kaplan:1983fs}. The flavour-violating
couplings in the above set of NP models are collected in Tables
\ref{tab:upFVyukawa} and \ref{tab:downFVyukawa}. Next, we briefly
discuss each of the above models, and show that the effects are either
suppressed by $1/\Lambda^2$, where $\Lambda$ is the NP scale, or are
proportional to the mixing angles with the extra scalars.

\underline{\it Dimension-Six Operators with Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV).}
We first assume that there is a mass gap between the SM and NP. Integrating out the NP states leads to dimension six operators (after absorbing the modifications of kinetic terms using equations of motion~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2009mx}), 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\label{eq:EFT:MFV}
	\mathcal{L}_{\rm EFT} &=  \frac{Y_u^\prime}{\Lambda^2}\bar{Q}_L H^c u_R
        (H^\dagger H)+ \frac{Y_d^\prime}{\Lambda^2} \bar{Q}_L H d_R
        (H^\dagger H)+\frac{Y_\ell^\prime}{\Lambda^2} \bar{L}_L H \ell_R
        (H^\dagger H)+\text{h.c.}\,, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which correct the SM Yukawa interactions. 
        Here $\Lambda$ is the NP scale and $H^c =
i\sigma_2H^\ast$. The fermion mass matrices and
Yukawa couplings after EWSB are 
\begin{equation}
M_f=\frac{v}{\sqrt2}\Big(Y_f +Y_f' \frac{v^2}{2 \Lambda^2}\Big)\,,
\qquad y_f=Y_f +3 Y_f' \frac{v^2}{2 \Lambda^2}\,, \qquad \quad f=u,d, \ell\,, 
\end{equation}
Because $Y_f$ and $Y_{f}'$ appear in two different combinations in
$M_f$ and in the physical Higgs Yukawa couplings, $y_f$, the two, in general, cannot be made diagonal in the
same basis and will lead to flavour-violating Higgs couplings.

In Tables \ref{tab:upyukawa}-\ref{tab:leptFVyukawa} we show the resulting $\kappa_f$ assuming MFV, i.e.,  that the flavour breaking in the NP sector is only due to the SM
Yukawas \cite{D'Ambrosio:2002ex, Chivukula:1987py,
  Gabrielli:1994ff, Ali:1999we, Buras:2000dm, Buras:2003jf,
  Kagan:2009bn}. This gives  $Y_u^{\prime}= a_uY_u +
        b^{\phantom\dagger}_uY^{\phantom\dagger}_uY_u^\dagger
        Y^{\phantom\dagger}_u + c^{\phantom\dagger}_u
        Y^{\phantom\dagger}_dY_d^\dagger
        Y^{\phantom\dagger}_u+\cdots\,,$ and similarly for $Y_d'$ with $u\leftrightarrow d$, while
        $a_q, b_q, c_q\sim {\mathcal O}(1)$ and are in general complex. For leptons we follow \cite{Dery:2013rta} and assume that the SM $Y_{\ell}$ is the only flavour-breaking spurion even for the neutrino mass matrix (see also \cite{Cirigliano:2005ck}). Then $Y_\ell'$ and $Y_{\ell}$ are diagonal in the same basis and there are no flavour-violating couplings. The flavour-diagonal $\kappa_\ell$ are given in Table \ref{tab:leptyukawa}.
        

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\underline{\it Multi-Higgs-doublet model with natural flavour conservation~(NFC).}
Natural flavour conservation in multi-Higgs-doublet models is an assumption that only one doublet, $H_u$, couples to the up-type quarks, only one Higgs doublet, $H_d$, couples to the down-type quarks, and only one doublet, $H_\ell$ couples to leptons (it is possible that any of these coincide, as in the SM where $H=H_u=H_d=H_\ell$)~\cite{Glashow:1976nt, Paschos:1976ay}. The neutral scalar components of $H_i$ are $(v_i+h_i)/\sqrt2$, where
$v^2=\sum_i v_i^2$. The dynamical fields $h_{i}$ are a linear combination of the neutral
Higgs mass eigen-states (and include $h_u$ and $h_d$). We thus have
$h_i=V_{hi} h + \ldots$, where $V_{hi}$ are elements of the unitary
matrix $V$ that diagonalises the neutral-Higgs mass terms and we only
write down the contribution of the lightest Higgs, $h$. NFC means that there are no tree-level Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNCs) and no $CP$
violation in the Yukawa interactions $\kappa_{qq'}=\tilde \kappa_{qq'}=0\,, \tilde \kappa_q=0$. 

There is a universal shift in all up-quark Yukawa couplings, $\kappa_u = \kappa_c = \kappa_t = V_{hu}{v}/{v_u}$. Similarly, there is a (different) universal shift in all down-quark Yukawa couplings and in all lepton Yukawa couplings, see Tables \ref{tab:upyukawa} - \ref{tab:leptyukawa}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\underline{\it Higgs sector of the MSSM at tree level.}
The MSSM tree-level Higgs potential and the couplings to quarks are
the same as in the type-II two-Higgs-doublet model, see, e.g.,
\cite{Haber:1984rc}. This is an example of a 2HDM with natural flavour
conservation in which $v_u=\sin\beta\, v$, $v_d=\cos\beta\,
v$. The mixing of $h_{u,d}$ into the Higgs mass-eigen-states $h$ and
$H$ is given by $h_u=\cos \alpha h+\sin\alpha H$, $h_d = -\sin\alpha h +\cos\alpha H$,
where $h$ is the observed SM-like Higgs. The up-quark Yukawa couplings are rescaled universally, 
$	\kappa_u = \kappa_c = \kappa_t=\cos\alpha/\sin\beta$, and similarly the down-quark Yukawas, 
	$\kappa_d = \kappa_s = \kappa_b = -\sin\alpha/\cos\beta$.
The flavour-violating and CP-violating Yukawas are zero\footnote{Note that beyond the tree level, in fine-tuned regions of parameter space the loops of sfermions and gauginos can lead to substantial corrections to these expressions \cite{Aloni:2015wvn}.}. In Tables \ref{tab:upyukawa}-\ref{tab:leptyukawa} we limit ourselves to the tree-level expectations, which are a good approximation for a large part of the MSSM parameter space.


In the alignment limit, $\beta-\alpha=\pi/2$ \cite{Gunion:2002zf,Carena:2013ooa,Dev:2014yca,Carena:2014nza,Dev:2015bta,Haber:2015pua,Carena:2015moc}, the Yukawa couplings tend toward their
SM value, $\kappa_i=1$.  The global fits to Higgs data in type-II 2HDM
already constrain $\beta-\alpha$ to be not to far from $\pi/2$~\cite{Carmi:2012in,
  Falkowski:2013dza, Grinstein:2013npa} so that the couplings of the light Higgs are also constrained to be close to their SM values. 
  Note that the decoupling limit of the 2HDM, where the heavy Higgs bosons become much heavier than the SM Higgs, implies the alignment limit while the reverse is not necessarily true \cite{Carena:2013ooa}.

\underline{\it Flavorful two-Higgs-doublet model.}
In~\cite{Altmannshofer:2015esa} a 2HDM setup was introduced in which one Higgs doublet couples only to top, bottom and tau, and a second Higgs doublet couples to the remaining fermions (see also~\cite{Botella:2016krk,Ghosh:2015gpa,Das:1995df,Blechman:2010cs}).
Such a 2HDM goes beyond NFC and therefore introduces FCNCs at tree level. However, the Yukawa couplings
of the first Higgs doublet to the third generation fermions preserve a $U(2)^5$ flavour symmetry, only
broken by the small couplings of the second Higgs doublet. This approximate $U(2)^5$ symmetry
leads to a strong suppression of the most sensitive flavour violating transitions between the second and first generation.

The non-standard flavour structure
of this ``flavourful'' 2HDM scenario leads to flavour non-universal modifications of all Higgs couplings. To be more precise $\kappa_t \neq \kappa_c = \kappa_u$, $\kappa_b \neq \kappa_s = \kappa_d$, and $\kappa_\tau \neq \kappa_\mu = \kappa_e$. CP violation in Higgs couplings can arise but is strongly suppressed by small fermion masses, see Tables \ref{tab:upyukawa} - \ref{tab:leptyukawa}. Also potentially sizeable flavour violating Higgs couplings involving the third generation fermions arise, see Tables \ref{tab:upFVyukawa} - \ref{tab:leptFVyukawa}.
As in all 2HDMs, the Higgs couplings approach their SM values in the alignment limit, $\beta-\alpha=\pi/2$.



%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\underline{\it A single Higgs doublet with Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism (FN).}
The Froggatt-Nielsen~\cite{Froggatt:1978nt} mechanism provides a simple explanation of the size and hierarchy of the SM Yukawa couplings. In the simplest realisation this is achieved by a $U(1)_H$ horizontal symmetry under which different generations of fermions carry different charges. The $U(1)_H$ is broken by a spurion, $\epsilon_H$.
The entries of the SM Yukawa matrix are then parametrically suppressed by powers of $\epsilon_H$ as, for example, in the lepton sector
\begin{equation}
\big(Y_\ell\big)_{ij}\sim \epsilon_H^{H(L_i)-H(e_j)},
\end{equation}
where $H(e,L)$ are the FN charges of the right- and left-handed charged lepton, respectively. The dimension 6 operators in \eqref{eq:EFT:MFV} due to electroweak NP have similar flavour suppression, $\big(Y_\ell'\big)_{ij}\sim \epsilon_H^{H(e_j)-H(L_i)} v^2/\Lambda^2$ \cite{Dery:2013rta,Dery:2014kxa}. After rotating to the mass eigen-basis, the lepton masses and mixing angles are then given by~\cite{Leurer:1993gy,Grossman:1995hk}
\begin{equation}
m_{\ell_i}/v \sim \epsilon_H^{|H(L_i)-H(e_i)|},\quad
	|U_{ij}|\sim \epsilon_H^{|H(L_i)-H(L_j)|},
\end{equation}
giving the Higgs Yukawa couplings in Tables~\ref{tab:leptyukawa}~and~\ref{tab:leptFVyukawa} in the row labelled `FN' \cite{Dery:2014kxa}.
Similarly for the quarks, after rotating to the mass eigen-basis, the masses and the mixings are given by~\cite{Leurer:1993gy} 
\begin{equation}
m_{u_i(d_i)}/v \sim \epsilon_H^{|H(Q_i)-H(u_i(d_i))|},\quad
|V_{ij}|\sim \epsilon_H^{|H(Q_i)-H(Q_j)|},
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing matrix and $H(u,d,Q)$ are the FN charges of the right-handed up and down and the left-handed quark fields, respectively.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\underline{\it Higgs-dependent Yukawa couplings (GL2)} In the model of
quark masses introduced by Giudice and Lebedev~\cite{Giudice:2008uua},
the quark masses, apart from the top mass, are small because they
arise from higher dimensional operators. The original GL proposal is
ruled out by data, while the straightforward modification to a 2HDM
(GL2) is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Higgs-dep}
\begin{split}
{\cal L}_{f}&=c_{ij}^{u} \bigg( \frac{H_1^\dagger H_1}{M^2}
  \bigg)^{n_{ij}^{u}} \, \bar Q_{L,i} u_{R,j} H_1 + c_{ij}^{d} \bigg( \frac{H_1^\dagger H_1}{M^2}
  \bigg)^{n_{ij}^{d}} \, \bar Q_{L,i} d_{R,j} H_2 + \phantom{c}\\
  &\qquad c_{ij}^\ell \bigg( \frac{H_1^\dagger H_1}{M^2}
  \bigg)^{n_{ij}^{\ell}} \, \bar L_{L,i} e_{R,j} H_2 +\text{h.c.}\,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the mass scale of the mediators.  In the original GL
model $H_2$ is identified with the SM Higgs, $H_2=H$, while
$H_1=H^c$. Taking $c_{ij}^{u,d}\sim {\mathcal
  O}(1)$, the ansatz $n_{ij}^{u,d}=a_i +b_j^{u,d}$ with $a=(1,1,0)$,
$b^d=(2,1,1)$, and $b^u=(2,0,0)$ then reproduces the hierarchies of
the observed quark masses and mixing angles for $\epsilon \equiv
v^2/M^2 \approx 1/60$. The Yukawa couplings are of the form $
y_{ij}^{u,d} = (2n_{ij}^{u,d} + 1) (y_{ij}^{u,d})_\text{SM}$. The SM
Yukawas are diagonal in the same basis as the quark masses,
while the $y_{ij}^{u,d}$ are not.  Because the bottom Yukawa is
largely enhanced, $\kappa_b \simeq 3$, this simplest version of the GL
model is already excluded by the Higgs data. Its modification, GL2, is
still viable, though \cite{Bishara:2015cha}. For
$v_1/v_2=\tan\beta\sim 1/\epsilon$ one can use the same ansatz for
$n_{ij}^{u,d}$ as before, modifying only $b^d$, so that $b^d=(1,0,0)$,
with the results shown in Tables
\ref{tab:upyukawa}-\ref{tab:leptFVyukawa}. For leptons we use the same
scalings as for right-handed quarks. Note that the $H_1^\dagger H_1$
is both a gauge singlet and a flavour singlet. From symmetry point of
view it is easier to build flavour models, if $H_1 H_2$ acts as a
spurion in \eqref{eq:Higgs-dep}, instead of $H_1^\dagger H_1$. This
possibility is severely constrained phenomenologically, though
\cite{Bauer:2015fxa,Bauer:2015kzy}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\underline{\it Randall-Sundrum models (RS).}
The Randall-Sundrum warped extra-dimensional model has been proposed to address
the hierarchy problem and simultaneously explain the hierarchy of the SM fermion
masses ~\cite{Randall:1999ee, Gherghetta:2000qt, Grossman:1999ra, Huber:2000ie,
	Huber:2003tu}. Integrating out the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of mass $m_{KK}$, and
working in the limit of a brane-localised Higgs, keeping only terms of leading
order in $v^2/m_{KK}^2$, the SM quark mass matrices are given
by~\cite{Azatov:2009na} (see also~\cite{Casagrande:2008hr, Bauer:2009cf,
	Malm:2013jia, Archer:2014jca, Blanke:2008zb, Blanke:2008yr, Albrecht:2009xr,
	Agashe:2006wa, Agashe:2014jca}, and Ref.~\cite{Dillon:2014zea} for a bulk Higgs
scenario) \begin{equation}\label{eq:RS:Mdu} M^{d(u)}_{ij}=\big[F_q
	Y_{1(2)}^{5D}F_{d(u)}\big]_{ij} v\,. \end{equation} The $F_{q,u,d}$ are $3\times
3$ matrices of fermion wave-function overlaps with the Higgs and are diagonal
and hierarchical. Assuming flavour anarchy, the 5D Yukawa matrices,
$Y_{1,2}^{5D}$, are general $3\times 3$ complex matrices with $\bar Y\sim
{\mathcal O}(1)$ entries, but usually $\bar Y \lesssim 4$, see, e.g.,
\cite{Archer:2014jca}. At leading order in $v^2/m_{KK}^2$ the Higgs Yukawas are
aligned with the quark masses, i.e., $M_{u,d}=y_{u,d} v/{\sqrt2}+{\mathcal
	O}(v^2/m_{KK}^2)$. The mis-alignments are generated by tree-level KK quark
exchanges, giving \begin{equation}\label{eq:misalignment}
	\big[y_{u(d)}\big]_{ij}-\frac{\sqrt2}{v}\big[M_{u,d}\big]_{ij}\sim -
	\frac{1}{3}F_{q_i} \bar Y^3 F_{u_j(d_j)}\frac{v^2}{m_{KK}^2}\,. \end{equation}


For the charged leptons, there are two choices for generating the hierarchy in
the masses~\cite{Azatov:2009na}. If left- and right-handed fermion profiles are
both hierarchical (and taken to be similar) then the misalignment between the
masses and Yukawas is $\sim \sqrt{{m_i m_j}/{v^2}} \times \mcO\big(\bar Y^2
v^2/m_{KK}^2\big)$. If only the right-handed profiles are hierarchical the
misalignment is given by (see also
Tables~\ref{tab:leptyukawa}~and~\ref{tab:leptFVyukawa})
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lept-misalignment}
	\big[y_\ell\big]_{ij}-\frac{\sqrt2}{v}\big[M_\ell\big]_{ij}\sim -
	\frac{1}{3}\yvmkk\,\frac{m_j^\ell}{v}\,. \end{equation} The Higgs mediated FCNCs
are suppressed by the same zero-mode wave-function overlaps that also suppress
the quark masses, \eqref{eq:RS:Mdu}, giving rise to the RS GIM
mechanism~\cite{Cacciapaglia:2007fw, Agashe:2004cp, Agashe:2004ay}. Using the
fact that the CKM matrix elements are given by $V_{ij}\sim F_{q_i}/F_{q_j}$ for
$i<j$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:misalignment}, one can rewrite the $\kappa_i$ as in
Tables~\ref{tab:upyukawa}-\ref{tab:downFVyukawa}. The numerical analysis of
Ref.~\cite{Azatov:2009na} found that for diagonal Yukawas typically
$\kappa_i<1$, with deviations in $\kappa_{t(b)}$ up to $30\%(15\%)$, and in
$\kappa_{s,c (u,d)}$ up to $\sim 5\%(1\%)$.
For the charged leptons one obtains deviations in $\kappa_{\tau\mu(\mu\tau)}\sim 1(5)\times 10^{-5}$~\cite{Azatov:2009na}.
These estimates were obtained fixing the mass of the first KK gluon excitation to
$3.7$~\UTeV, above the present ATLAS bound \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2015-009}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\underline{\it Composite pseudo-Goldstone Higgs (pNGB).}
Finally, we assume that the Higgs is a
pseudo-Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a
global symmetry in a strongly coupled sector, and  couples to the composite
sector with a typical coupling $y_*$ \cite{Dugan:1984hq,
  Georgi:1984ef, Kaplan:1983sm, Kaplan:1983fs} (for a review, see~\cite{Panico:2015jxa}).
Assuming partial compositeness, the SM fermions couple linearly to composite operators
$O_{L,R}$,
$\lambda_{L,i}^q \bar Q_{L,i} O_R^i+\lambda_{R,j}^u \bar u_{R,j}
O_L^j+h.c. \,,$
where $i,j$ are flavour indices~\cite{Kaplan:1991dc}. This is the 4D dual of fermion
mass generation in 5D RS models.  The SM masses and Yukawa
couplings arise from expanding the two-point functions of the
$O_{L,R}$ operators in powers of the Higgs field~\cite{Agashe:2009di}.

The new ingredient compared to the EFT analysis in \eqref{eq:EFT:MFV}
is that the shift symmetry due to the pNGB nature of the Higgs
dictates the form of the higher-dimensional operators. The flavour
structure and the composite Higgs coset structure completely factorise
if the SM fields couple to only one composite operator. The general
decomposition of Higgs couplings then becomes \cite{Agashe:2009di}
(see also \cite{Gillioz:2012se,Delaunay:2013iia,Azatov:2014lha})
\begin{equation}\label{eq:comp}
	Y_u \bar{Q}_L H u_R + Y_u^\prime\bar{Q}_L H u_R
        \frac{(H^\dagger H)}{\Lambda^2}+\ldots \quad \to \quad
        c_{ij}^u \, P(h/f) \, \bar{Q}_L^i H u_R^j \,,
\end{equation}
and similarly for the down quarks. Here $f\gtrsim v$ is the equivalent
of the pion decay constant, while $P(h/f)=a_0+a_2 (H^\dagger H/f^2)+\ldots
$ is an analytic function whose form is fixed by the  pattern of the
spontaneous breaking and the embedding of the SM fields in the global
symmetry of the strongly coupled sector. In \eqref{eq:comp} the flavour
structure of $Y_u$ and $Y_u'$ 
is the same. The resulting corrections to the quark Yukawa couplings 
are therefore strictly diagonal, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kappaq:estimate}
\kappa_q\sim 1+{\mathcal O}\big({v^2}/{f^2}\big).
\end{equation}
For example, for the models based on the breaking of $SO(5)$ to
$SO(4)$, the diagonal Yukawa couplings can be written as
$\kappa_q=(1+2m-(1+2m+n)(v/f)^2)/{\sqrt{1-(v/f)^2}}$, where $n,m$ are
positive integers~\cite{Pomarol:2012qf}. The Minimal Composite Higgs
Model 4 (MCHM4) corresponds to $m=n=0$, while MCHM5 is given by
$m=0,n=1$.

The flavour-violating contributions to the quark Yukawa couplings
arise only from corrections to the quark kinetic terms~\cite{Agashe:2009di},
\begin{equation}
\bar q_L i \slashed q_L \frac{H^\dagger H}{\Lambda^2}, \,\,
\bar u_R i \slashed u_R \frac{H^\dagger H}{\Lambda^2},
\dots\,,
\end{equation}
due to the exchanges of composite vector resonances
with typical mass $M_* \sim \Lambda$. After using the equations of
motion 
these give (neglecting relative ${\mathcal O}(1)$ contributions
in the sum)~\cite{Agashe:2009di, Azatov:2014lha, Delaunay:2013pja},
\begin{equation}
\kappa_{ij}^u\sim 2 y_*^2 \frac{v^2}{M_*^2}
\Big(\lambda_{L,i}^q\lambda_{L,j}^q \frac{m_{u_j}}{v}
+\lambda_{R,i}^u\lambda_{R,j}^u \frac{m_{u_i}}{v}\Big)\,,
\end{equation}
and similarly for the down quarks. If the strong sector is CP
violating, then $\tilde \kappa_{ij}^{u,d}\sim \kappa_{ij}^{u,d}$.

The exchange of composite vector resonances also contributes to the
flavour-diagonal Yukawa couplings, shifting the
estimate~\eqref{eq:kappaq:estimate} by 
$\Delta \kappa_{q_i}\sim 2 y_*^2 \frac{v^2}{M_*^2}
\Big[\big(\lambda_{L,i}^q\big)^2+ \big(\lambda_{R,i}^u\big)^2\Big] \,$.
This shift can be large for the quarks with a large composite
component if the Higgs is strongly coupled to the vector resonances,
$y_*\sim 4\pi$, and these resonances are relatively light, $M_*\sim
4\pi v\sim 3$ \UTeV. The left-handed top and bottom, as well as the
right-handed top, are expected to be composite, explaining the large
top mass (i.e., $\lambda_{L,3}^q\sim \lambda_{R,3}^u\sim 1$). In the
anarchic flavour scenario, one expects the remaining quarks to be
mostly elementary (so the remaining $\lambda_i\ll 1$).  
If there is some underlying flavour alignment, it is also possible that
the light quarks are composite. This is most easily achieved in the
right-handed sector~\cite{Redi:2011zi, Redi:2012uj,
  Delaunay:2013iia}.

In the case of the lepton sector, if we assume that there are no
hierarchies in the composite sector~\cite{Redi:2013pga} (see also~\cite{Csaki:2008qq,delAguila:2010vg,Hagedorn:2011un,Hagedorn:2011pw}), then the NP
effects in the flavour diagonal and off-diagonal Yukawas are
negligible. For this reason, we do not report them in Tables \ref{tab:leptyukawa} and \ref{tab:leptFVyukawa}.




\asubsection[O.A. De Aguiar Francisco, M. Schlaffer, L. Sestini, E. Stamou]{Inclusive Search with Flavor tagging (charm and strange)}

\asubsubsection{Charm quark tagging}

In the SM, the coupling of the Higgs to bottom quarks is small, i.e.,
$y_b^{\text{SM}}\simeq 0.016$ at $\mu=m_H$, and 
its coupling to charm quarks even smaller by roughly four times,
i.e., $y_c^{\text{SM}}\simeq 0.0036$ at $\mu=m_H$.
Nevertheless, due to phase-space the process $H\to b\bar b$ is the dominant 
decay mode of the Higgs in the SM.
This situation has not only made a roughly $30\%$ precise measurement of such 
a small coupling possible at Run I of the LHC, but has also created 
opportunities to measure possible order one deviations in the 
coupling of the Higgs to charm quarks.

An important difference between the charm- and to some extent also the strange-quark (see section~\ref{sec:strange-tagging}) with respect to up- and 
down-quarks is that it is possible to pursue an inclusive approach in
identifying the flavour of the final state particles by $c$-tagging jets.
The underlying geometrical/kinematic input necessary for $c$-tagging
is similar to $b$-tagging with the most relevant one being the identification
of displaced vertices due to the lifetime of $c$-hadrons.
$c$-tagging has been used early on in Run I of the LHC by ATLAS and CMS in searches for supersymmetry, e.g., Refs.~\cite{Aad:2014nra,Aad:2015gna}.
Its usefulness in relations to Higgs physics was first discussed in Ref.~\cite{Delaunay:2013pja} and subsequently
used in Ref.~\cite{Perez:2015aoa} to recast ATLAS's and CMS's Run~I analyses for $h\to b\bar b$ to provide the first direct LHC 
constraint on the charm Yukawa. 

The inclusive method of probing the charm-quark Yukawa is in many ways complementary 
to searches for exclusive decays (see discussion of section~\ref{sec:exclusiveHiggs}) or 
searches for deviations in Higgs distributions (see section \ref{sec:HiggsDist}).
For example, in the inclusive approach an underlying assumption is 
that the Higgs coupling to $WW$ and $ZZ$ ---entering Higgs production--- is SM-like,
while the interpretation of Higgs distributions assumes no additional new physics contribution that affects them in a significant way.
An important difference between the inclusive and the exclusive approach is that the latter relies on interference with the SM $H\to \gamma\gamma$ amplitude while the former does not.
Therefore, in principle the exclusive approach may be sensitive to the sign and 
$CP$ properties of the coupling to which the inclusive approach is insensitive to.
At the same time, measurements of exclusive decays of the Higgs are challenging due 
to the small probability of fragmenting into the specific final state and 
large QCD backgrounds, which is why the inclusive approach appears to be the most promising one to probe deviations in the magnitude of the Higgs to charm coupling.

\end{figure}

The most straight-forward way of inclusively probing the charm-quark Yukawa is by 
expanding the search for $H\to b\bar b$ to search for 
$pp \to (Z/W\to\ell\ell/\nu) (H\to c\bar c)$ \cite{Perez:2015aoa}
(left and central panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:higgsproductionHcc}).
Another possibility discussed in Ref.~\cite{Brivio:2015fxa} is to search for deviations in Higgs production 
in association with a charm quark in which the Higgs is produced from a charm-quark in the proton 
parton-distribution functions (right panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:higgsproductionHcc}).
We focus here on the measurement from $pp\to VH$ events proposed in Ref.~\cite{Perez:2015aoa}
and recently performed on a $36.1$~fb$^{-1}$ sample of $ZH$ data by ATLAS \cite{Aaboud:2018fhh}
at $\sqrt{s}=13$~\UTeV.
The following two key elements for this measurement are discussed below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[i)] The experimental sensitivity in discriminating between $c$-jets from
		background $b$- and light-jets.
	\item[ii)] Disentangling the charm-quark coupling from the 
		bottom-quark Yukawa (breaking the degeneracy).
\end{itemize}

	in ATLAS's $c$-tagger employed in the analysis of Ref.~\cite{Aaboud:2018fhh}.
\label{fig:ATLASctagefficiency}}
\end{figure}

Jet flavour tagging algorithms rely on Monte-Carlo simulations  to assign a probability 
for a given jet to be produced from a specific quark-flavour. 
Therefore, the efficiency / confidence in associating a jet to a specific quark is 
correlated with the confidence to reject other hypotheses, e.g., production from light-quarks.
%ATLAS's recent search \cite{Aaboud:2018fhh} demonstrated that its  $c$-tagging capabilities are significantly stronger than anticipated.
%LHCb's capabilities of $c$-tagging and its sensitivity to $H\to c\bar c$ is discussed below.
The $c$-tagging tagging working point chosen in the ATLAS analysis \cite{Aaboud:2018fhh}  has an  efficiency of approximately $41\%$
to tag $c$-jets and rejection factors of roughly $4$ and $20$ for $b$- and light-quark-jets, respectively.
In Figure~\ref{fig:ATLASctagefficiency} 
the correlation between $c$-tagging efficiency and rejection factors is shown.
%This ATLAS result provides to date the most stringent limit in direct searches 
%for the inclusive decay of Higgs boson to charm quarks, 
The observed limit is $\sigma(pp\to ZH)\text{BR}(H\to c\bar c)<2.7$\,pb at $95\%$ CL.
To translate this cross-section bound to a non-trivial constraint on $y_c$ it is essential 
to include the additional production channel from large charm Yukawa 
(central panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:higgsproductionHcc}) as demonstrated in Refs.~\cite{Perez:2015aoa}.
The additional production channel is affected by the kinematics, e.g., $p_T$ of the 
$Z$ and thus depends on the details of the analysis. 
This ``unfolding'' / reinterpretation of the analysis is thus best performed by 
the analysis itself and cannot be avoided to obtain non-trivial constraints on the Yukawa itself.
Note that at the moment the systematic uncertainties are approximately a factor of two
larger than the statistical uncertainties of the $36.1$\,fb$^{-1}$ sample used in the analysis;
the largest systematic uncertainty is associated to flavour-tagging and the tagging of $c$-jets in particular.

Given the rather similar lifetime of $b$ and $c$ hadrons, there is always
a non-negligible ``contamination'' of the $c$-jet sample 
from jets originating from $b$ quarks~\cite{Perez:2015aoa}.
An inclusive $H\to c\bar c$ analysis probing $y_c$ must thus either assume a SM value 
for the bottom Yukawa (as done in Ref.~\cite{Aaboud:2018fhh}) or allow the 
simultaneous variation of $y_b$ and $y_c$ to break the degeneracy.  
One possibility to achieve this is discussed  in Refs.~\cite{Perez:2015aoa,Perez:2015lra} where more than one tagging working point with different ratios of $c$-tagging to $b$-tagging efficiency are applied.
%In this way, it possible to gain sensitivity to the two independent contributions 
%that enter the search's signal strength, i.e., $\mu_c$ and $\mu_b$.
%Though possible this has not been done in ATLAS's latest $13$ TeV search.
%It is, however, encouraging that the results presented there would only be mildly 
%affected by this (see discussion within Ref.~\cite{Aaboud:2018fhh}).

The prospects of measuring 
the rate of $pp\to ZH(\to c\bar c)$ at the HL-LHC are published in  \cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2018-016}.
The study uses the Run II analysis \cite{Aaboud:2018fhh} and rescales the results 
to an integrated luminosity of $3000$~fb$^{-1}$.
Possibilities to reduce the systematic uncertainties are discussed as well.
The analysis finds that, if there is no significant NP contribution, 
an upper bound  on the signal strength 
 of $\mu_{ZH(c\bar c)} <6.3$ at $95\%$ CL can be set.
%Yet the collaboration has not unfolded the results to interpret them as 
%limits on the charm Yukawa,
%for which the additional production mechanism must be included (see above).
This result is to be compared with  Ref.~\cite{Perez:2015lra}
in which  the prospects for measuring $H\to b\bar b$ at $\sqrt{s}=14$\,\UTeV 
\cite{ATLAS-collaboration:2012iza} are recast 
 to obtain an inclusive measurement of $H\to c \bar c$.
In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:inclusiveforecast} a $c$-tagging efficiency of $30\%$ ($c$-tag I) is used while $50\%$ ($c$-tag II)  is used in the right panel. 
In both cases the $b$-jet rejection was chosen to be $5$ and the light-jet rejection
$200$.
These two tagging working points cover the currently employed tagging working point in which
the $c$-tagging efficiency is approximately $41\%$.
In the analysis both the charm and the bottom quark are treated as free variables;
the bottom-Yukawa direction is profiled away to project the sensitivity to the 
charm-quark Yukawa.
It was found that with $2\times 3000$\,fb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=14$\,\UTeV the 
high-luminosity stage of the LHC probes values of $y_c/y_c^{\text{SM}}\simeq 21 (6)$ with
$c$-tag I ($c$-tag II)  at $95\%$ CL, indicated by the blue regions in Figure~\ref{fig:inclusiveforecast}.
%The recent ATLAS analysis has studied the systematic uncertainties associated 
%to such measurements, in particular the uncertainties associated to $c$-tagging.
%Such uncertainties could not have been included in the above initial analysis of
%the future study, but are to a large extend include in ATLAS's %study~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2018-016}.

Even though the LHCb experiment operates at lower luminosity  compared to ATLAS and CMS, it has unique capabilities for discrimination between $b$- and $c$-jets thanks to its excellent vertex reconstruction system~\cite{Aaij:2015yqa}. With the secondary vertex tagging (SV-tagging) LHCb achieved an identification efficiency of 60$\%$ on $b$-jets, of 25$\%$ on $c$-jets and a light jets (light quarks or gluons) mis-identification probability of less than 0.2$\%$. Further discrimination between light and heavy jets and between $b$- and $c$-jets is achieved by exploiting the secondary vertex kinematic properties, using Boosted Decision Tree techniques (BDTs): for instance an additional cut on the BDT that separates $b$- from $c$-jets removes 90$\%$ of $H\rightarrow b \bar{b}$ while retaining 62$\%$ of $H\rightarrow c \bar{c}$ events  ~\cite{LHCb:2016yxg}. In the $H\rightarrow c \bar{c}$ search it is crucial to remove the $H\rightarrow b \bar{b}$ contribution since it represents an irreducible background source.

The LHCb acceptance covers $\sim 5$\% of the associated production of $W/Z+H$ at 13 \UTeV.  Figure~\ref{fig:hbbetas} shows the coverage of  LHCb for the $b\bar{b}$ pair produced in the decay of the  Higgs boson in association with a vector boson. When the two $b$-jets are within the acceptance, the lepton from $W/Z$ tends to be in acceptance as well ($\sim 60$\% of times). Due to the forward geometry, Lorentz-boosted Higgs bosons are  likely to be properly reconstructed.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{\main/section7/plots/hbb_etas}
	\caption{2D histogram showing the coverage of the LHCb acceptance for the $b\bar{b}$ pair produced by the Higgs decay in associated production with a W or a Z boson.}
	\label{fig:hbbetas}
\end{figure}

LHCb set  upper limits on the $V+H(\rightarrow b \bar{b})$ and $V+H(\rightarrow c \bar{c})$ production~\cite{LHCb:2016yxg} with data from LHC Run I.
Without any improvements in the analysis or detector, the extrapolation of this  to 300fb$^{-1}$ at 14\,\UTeV leads to a sensitivity of $\mu^{cc}\lesssim 50\,$. 

Detector improvements are expected in future upgrades, in particular in impact parameter resolution which directly affects the $c$-tagging performance. 
If the detector improvement is taken into account, the $c$-jet tagging efficiency with the SV-tagging is expected to  improve as shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:c-tag-eff}.  
A further improvement is expected from the electron reconstruction due to upgraded versions of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Electrons are used in the identification of the vector bosons associated with the Higgs.
Therefore, with these improvements, the expected limit can be pushed down to $\mu^{cc}\lesssim 5-10$ which corresponds to a limit of 2-3 times the Standard Model prediction on the charm Yukawa coupling.
This extrapolation does not include improvements in analysis techniques: for instance  Deep Learning methods can be applied to exploit correlations in  jets substructure properties to reduce the backgrounds.
%The LHCb extrapolation shown here is quite conservative. An improved LHCb analysis on H->cc prospects is still ongoing. If approved in time by the collaboration the updated results will be included in this section.

\subsubsection{Strange quark tagging}
\label{sec:strange-tagging}

Tagging strange jets from Higgs decays provides an alternative method to exclusive Higgs decays~\cite{Kagan:2014ila, Perez:2015lra, Koenig:2015pha, Aaboud:2016rug, Aaboud:2017xnb,Alte:2016yuw} for constraining the Yukawa coupling of the strange quark. See \Bref{Soreq:2016rae, Yu:2016rvv, Bishara:2016jga, Gao:2016jcm} for approaches using event shape and kinematic
observables. The main idea behind the strange tagger described in~\Bref{Duarte-Campderros:2018ouv} is that
strange quarks---more than other partons---hadronise to prompt kaons that carry a large fraction of the jet momentum. Based on this idea a tagger is constructed to allow for an estimate of the
capabilities in measurements involving strange quarks. Although the current focus at LHC is on
mainly on charm and bottom tagging, recognising strange jets has been attempted before at
DELPHI~\cite{Boudinov:1998fao} and SLD~\cite{Kalelkar:2000ig}, albeit in $Z$ decays.

The shown results are based on an analysis of event samples of Higgs and $W$ events generated with
\texttt{PYTHIA} 8.219~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za, Sjostrand:2014zea}. In each of the two hemispheres of the resonance decay, the charged pions and kaons stemming from the resonance are selected with an
assumed efficiency of 95\%. Similarly, $K_s$ are identified with an efficiency of 85\% if they decay
within \Unit{80}{cm} of the interaction point into a $\pi^+\pi^-$ pair that allows to reconstruct
the decaying neutral kaon. Among the two lists of Kaon candidates---one per hemisphere---one Kaon of
each list is chosen for further analysis such that the scalar sum of their momenta is maximised
while rejecting charged same-sign pairs. The events are separated into the categories
charged-charged~(CC), charged-neutral~(CN) and neutral-neutral~(NN) with a relative abundance of about CC:CN:NN$\approx 9:6:1$ from isospin considerations and branching ratios by the charges of the selected Kaon candidates.

All selected candidates are required to carry a large momentum $p_{||}$ along the hemisphere
axis. This cut allows to reduce the background from gluon jets as gluons radiate more than quarks
and therefore tend to spread their energy among more final state particles. In addition, charged Kaons need to be produced promptly, in order to reject heavy flavor jets. This latter requirement is implemented by a cut on the impact parameter $d_0$ after the truth value has been smeared by the detector resolution.
\begin{figure}[t]

  \caption{Efficiencies as function of the cut on $p_{||}$ and for $d_0<$\Unit{14}{$\mu$m} to
    reconstruct the different Higgs decay channels and $W$ decays as $s\bar s$ event by the
    described tagger. The left plot shows the CC channel, the right the CN channel.}
  \label{fig:stagger-efficiencies}
\end{figure}

The efficiencies obtained in the CC and CN channel for a cut of $d_0<$\Unit{14}{$\mu$m} are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:stagger-efficiencies}. While there is clearly still ample room for improvement, this
simple tagger shows already a good suppression by orders of magnitude of the bottom, charm and gluon
background. Due to missing particle identification, the efficiencies for first-generation jets and
strange jets are degenerate in the CC channel. However, in the CN channel, due to the required
$K_s$, a suppression of pions is achieved that breaks this degeneracy. This is particularly
interesting in light of the HL-LHC, where a large background from first generation jets is expected.


\asubsection[Y. Soreq]{Exclusive Higgs decays}
\label{sec:exclusiveHiggs}

Exclusive Higgs decays to a vector meson ($V$) and a photon, $h\to V\gamma$, directly probe the Higgs bottom, charm~\cite{Bodwin:2013gca,Bodwin:2014bpa} strange, down and up~\cite{Kagan:2014ila} quark Yukawas, as well as to the flavor violating couplings. 
For improved theory predictions see~\cite{Koenig:2015pha}.
Within the LHC, the Higgs exclusive decays are the only direct probe of the $u$ and $d$ Yukawa couplings. If $s$-tagging will be implemented at the LHC, than the strange Yukawa will be probed both inclusive and exclusive as charm and bottom.  
On the experimental side, both ATLAS and CMS report first upper bounds on $h\to J/\psi\gamma$~\cite{Aad:2015sda,Khachatryan:2015lga}, $h\to\phi\gamma$ and $h\to\rho\gamma$~\cite{Aaboud:2016rug,Aaboud:2017xnb}. 
The $h \to VZ, ZW$ modes as a probe of the Higgs electroweak coupling are discussed  in~\cite{Isidori:2013cla}. 
Finally, $Z$ exclusive decays are considered in~\cite{Grossmann:2015lea,Alte:2015dpo} and can be served as a test of QCD factorisation. 

The Higgs exclusive decays which involve $V=\rho,\omega,\phi,J/\psi,\Upsilon$ are sensitive to the diagonal Yukawa couplings. 
These receive contributions from two amplitudes which are denoted as direct and indirect, see Fig.~\ref{fig:hexlusive}. 
The direct amplitude, first analysed in~\cite{Keung:1983ac}, involves a hard $h\to q\bar{q}\gamma$ vertex and sensitive to the $q$-quark Yukawa. 
The indirect process is mediated by $h\gamma\gamma$ vertex which is followed by a $\gamma^*\to V$ fragmentation. 
Since the indirect contribution is larger than the direct, the largest sensitivity to the Higgs $q$-quark coupling is via the interference between the two diagrams. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It is beneficial to consider the ratio between $h\to V\gamma$ and $h\to\gamma\gamma$ or $h\to ZZ^*\to4\ell$ as various of theoretical uncertainties and the dependence of the Higgs total width are cancelled~\cite{Perez:2015aoa,Koenig:2015pha}. Moreover, since the Higgs production is inclusive for all of these modes, it cancelled in the ratio to large extension. Thus, we can write 
% 
\begin{align}
	\cR_{V\gamma,f} 
=	\frac{\mu_{V\gamma} }{\mu_{f}}  \frac{ \BR^{\rm SM}_{h\to V\gamma}}{ \BR^{\rm SM}_{h\to f}}  
	\simeq  
	\frac{\Gamma_{h\to V\gamma}}{ \Gamma_{h\to f}}  \, ,
\end{align}
%
where $f=ZZ^*, \gamma\gamma\,$, $\mu_X = \sigma_h \BR_{X}/\sigma^{\rm SM}_h \BR^{\rm SM}_{X}$, the superscript ``SM" denotes the SM values and we assume a perfect cancellation of the production mechanism. 
For simplicity, we assume CP even Higgs coupling and find 
%
\begin{align}
	\cR_{V\gamma,f} 
=& 	\alpha_{V,f} \abs{1 - \left(\Delta^R_V+ i \Delta^I_V \right)\frac{\bar{\kappa}_V}{\kappa^{\rm eff}_{\gamma\gamma}} + \Delta^U_V}^2  \, , 	
\end{align}
%
with
%
\begin{align}	
	\alpha_{V,\gamma\gamma}
=&	6\frac{\Gamma_{V\to e^+e^-}}{\alpha \, m_V} \left( 1 - \frac{m^2_V}{m^2_h} \right)^2 \, , \quad\quad
%
	\alpha_{V,ZZ^*}
= \abs{\frac{\kappa^{\rm eff}_{\gamma\gamma}}{\kappa_{Z}}}^2  \frac{\Gamma^{\rm SM}_{h\to\gamma\gamma}}{\Gamma^{\rm SM}_{h\to ZZ^*\to 4\ell}}\alpha_{V,\gamma\gamma} \, ,
\end{align}
%
where $\kappa_X$ is the normalised coupling with respect to its SM value. Below, we adopted the numerical values of $\Delta^X_V$ from Ref.~\cite{Koenig:2015pha}.
The advantage of use $h\to\gamma\gamma$ for the normalisation is that there are only two unknown - the Higgs coupling to di-photon and the quark Yukawa. 
However, since $h\to ZZ^*$ is a very clean channel is serve as a good channel to use for the normalisation. 
Moreover, by combing the Higgs data with the electroweak precision measurements, the Higgs coupling to $ZZ$ is known to a few percent level~\cite{Falkowski:2013dza,deBlas:2016ojx}, thus, there is no additional large uncertainty.  
We note that with the current data the bounds evaluating by using $\cR_{V\gamma,ZZ^*}$ are slightly stronger than the ones from $\cR_{V\gamma,\gamma\gamma}$. 

For the interpretation of the experimental results in term of bounds on the different Yukawa coupling we follow Refs.~\cite{Perez:2015aoa,Perez:2015lra}. 
Denoting the 95\,\%\,CL bound on the ratio $\cR_{V\gamma,f}$ as $\cR_{V\gamma,f}^{95}$ we can write 
%
\begin{align}
	\frac{\Delta^R_V - \sqrt{  \frac{(\Delta^R_V)^2 + (\Delta^I_V)^2    }{\alpha_{V\gamma,f}} \cR_{V\gamma,f}^{95}   - (\Delta^I_V)^2 } }{ (\Delta^R_V)^2 + (\Delta^I_V)^2 } 
	< \frac{\bar{\kappa}_V}{\kappa^{\rm eff}_{\gamma\gamma}} < 
	\frac{\Delta^R_V + \sqrt{  \frac{(\Delta^R_V)^2 + (\Delta^I_V)^2    }{\alpha_{V\gamma,f}} \cR_{V\gamma,f}^{95}   - (\Delta^I_V)^2 } }{ (\Delta^R_V)^2 + (\Delta^I_V)^2 }  \, ,
\end{align}
%
where we neglect $\Delta^U_V$ as it is a small correction. 
Moreover, neglecting $\Delta^I_V$ we get simplified formula, which hold to good accuracy, 
%
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:Rsimp}
	\frac{1 - \sqrt{  \cR_{V\gamma,f}^{95}/\alpha_{V\gamma,f} } }{ \Delta^R_V} 
	< \frac{\bar{\kappa}_V}{\kappa^{\rm eff}_{\gamma\gamma}} < 
	\frac{1 + \sqrt{  \cR_{V\gamma,f}^{95}/\alpha_{V\gamma,f} } }{ \Delta^R_V}  \, .

The prospects for probing light quark Yukawa within future LHC runs and for future colliders are estimated in Ref.~\cite{Perez:2015lra}, which we follow here. 
One of the important implications of the first upper bounds on the different exclusive modes is that the measurement is background dominated. Thus, even for future runs, without significant improvement of the analysis, we expect only upper bounds.  
Given an upper bound on $\cR^{95}_{V\gamma,f}(E_1,\cL_1)$, where $E_1\,(\cL_1)$ stands for the collider energy\,(integrated luminosity), the estimated bound with $E_2$ and $\cL_2$ is
%
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:Rscale}
	\cR^{95}_{V\gamma,f}(E_2,\cL_2)
=	\cR^{95}_{V\gamma,f}(E_1,\cL_1) \sqrt{ \frac{1}{R_E} \frac{\sigma^{\rm SM}_{h,E_1} \cL_1  }{\sigma^{\rm SM}_{h,E_2} \cL_2} } \, ,
\end{align}
%
where $\sigma^{\rm SM}_{h,E_{1,2}}$ is the SM Higgs production cross section, $R_{E} = (S_{E_1}^{\rm SM}/B_{E_1})/(S_{E_2}^{\rm SM}/B_{E_2})$ with $S(B)$ the number of signal\,(background) events, which encoded the difference in the analysis details and assumed to be 1 here. 
In Table~\ref{tab:exclusiveproj},we combine Eqs.~\eqref{eq:Rsimp} and \eqref{eq:Rscale} along with the current bounds to estimate the future projections of probing the different light quark Yukawa. 
We note that the estimation in Table~\ref{tab:exclusiveproj} is in agreement with the ATLAS projection of $h\to J/\psi\gamma$~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-043}, which quote $\cR_{J/\psi\gamma,ZZ^*}<0.34^{+0.14}_{-0.1}$

In addition to the Higgs diagonal Yukawa, in principle, Higgs exclusive decays can probe off-diagonal couplings by measuring modes such as $h\to B^*_s \gamma$~\cite{Kagan:2014ila}. 
These processes receive contribution only from the direct amplitude and there is not enhancement from interference with the relative large indirect amplitude. 
Moreover, the Higgs flavor violating couplings are strongly constrained by meson mixing~\cite{Blankenburg:2012ex,Harnik:2012pb}. Thus, the expected rates are too small to be observe. 
For a detailed discussion on the $h \to VZ,VW$ channels see~\cite{Alte:2016yuw}.



\asubsection[Y. Soreq]{Lepton flavor violating decays of the Higgs}

The flavour violating Yukawa couplings are well constrained by the low-energy
flavour-changing neutral current measurements
\cite{Harnik:2012pb,Blankenburg:2012ex,Gorbahn:2014sha}. A notable
exception are the flavour-violating couplings involving a tau lepton. The
strongest constraints on $\kappa_{\tau\mu}, \kappa_{\mu\tau},
\kappa_{\tau e}, \kappa_{e \tau}$ are thus from direct searches of flavour-violating Higgs decays at
the LHC \cite{Sirunyan:2017xzt,Aad:2016blu}.
Currently, the CMS 13\,\UTeV with 35.9\,fb$^{-1}$~\cite{Sirunyan:2017xzt} is the strongest constrain 
%
\begin{align}
    \sqrt{y_{\mu\tau}^2 + y^2_{\tau\mu}} < 1.43 \times 10^{-3}\, , \qquad
    \sqrt{y_{e\tau}^2 + y^2_{\tau e}} < 2.26 \times 10^{-3}\, ,
\end{align}
%
which corresponds to upper 95\,\%~CL on the branching ratio of $0.25\,$\% and $0.61\,$\% for $\mu\tau$ and $e\tau$, respectively. In addition, we note that once can directly measure the difference between the branching ratios of $h\to\tau e$ and $h\to\tau\mu$ as proposed in~\cite{Bressler:2014jta}.
Naively, assuming that both systematics and statistical error scale with square root of the luminosity, one can expect that the sensitivity of the HL-LHC with $3000\,$fb$^{-1}$ will be  around the half per-mil level for the branching ratio of $h\to e\tau$ or $\to \mu\tau$. 


The LHC can also set bounds on rare FCNC top decays involving a Higgs~\cite{Aaboud:2017mfd,Khachatryan:2016atv,Aad:2015pja,Aad:2014dya}. The strongest current bound, for example, is $\sqrt{|\kappa_{ct}|^2+|\kappa_{tc}|^2}<0.06$ at 95\,\%~CL.

\asubsection[F. Yu, A. Schmidt, T. Klijnsma, Y. Soreq]{Yukawa constraints from Higgs distributions}
\label{sec:HiggsDist}

\asubsubsection{Determinations of Higgs boson coupling modifiers using differential distributions}


The distribution of the transverse momentum $p_T$ of the Higgs boson has been considered before as a probe of high scale new physics running in the $ggh$ loop \cite{Arnesen:2008fb,Biekotter:2016ecg,Brehmer:2015rna,Dawson:2015gka,Schlaffer:2014osa,Grojean:2013nya,Langenegger:2015lra,Bramante:2014hua,Buschmann:2014twa,Azatov:2013xha,Banfi:2013yoa,Buschmann:2014sia}. 
In addition, the soft spectrum is an indirect probe of the Higgs coupling to light quarks~\cite{Soreq:2016rae,Bishara:2016jga}. 
Higgs production modes due to quark fusion, which are negligible in the SM, have two effects on the distributions of kinematic variables. 
%
First, the Sudakov peak will be at lower $p_T$ around 5\,\UGeV vs 10\,\UGeV for gluon fusion, see~\cite{Collins:1984kg}. This is because the effective radiation strength of gluons is several times larger than that of quarks, $\alpha_s N_c$ vs. $\alpha_s (N^2_c-1)/(2N_c)$, with $N_c=3$. This leads to harder $p_T$ spectra for gluon fusion compared to quark scattering. 
Therefore, the $u\bar{u}$ or $d\bar{d}$ scattering leads to a much sharper peak at lower $p_T$ compared to  $gg$ scattering~\cite{Soreq:2016rae}.
Second, in the SM, the Higgs production is dominated by  gluon fusion, where the two gluons carry similar partonic $x$. This leads to a peak at zero Higgs rapidity. However, for $u\bar u$ or $d\bar d$ fusion, the valance quark will carry larger partonic $x$ than the sea anti-quark. This leads to a peak in the forward direction. 
%
In case of enhanced $s$ or $c$ Yukawa couplings, the dominant effect is the one loop of the quarks in the $gg\to hj$ process, which has double logarithms behaviour and peaks towards lower $p_T$ of the Higgs boson~\cite{Baur:1989cm}. This will also result in a softer Higgs $p_T$ spectrum~\cite{Bishara:2016jga}, which can be used to constrain the charm and strange Yukawa. 
%
The impact of effect on various kinematic distributions is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HiggsDist}. 
Many theoretical and experimental uncertainties are cancelled in  the normalised kinematic distributions, $(1/\sigma)d\sigma/dX$ with $X=p_T, y_h$, see for example~\cite{Soreq:2016rae}.
Thus, the use of them will result in a better sensitivity for probing the light quark Yukawa.

In Ref.~\cite{Soreq:2016rae}, the 8\,\UTeV ATLAS results~\cite{Aad:2015lha} have been used to evaluate a first bound on the $u$ and $d$ Yukawa from kinematic distributions. The resulting $95\,\%$ CL regions obtained from the  $p_T$ distribution are
%
\begin{align}
	\bar{\kappa}_u = y_u/y^{\rm SM}_b < 0.46 \, , \qquad\qquad
	\bar{\kappa}_d = y_d/y^{\rm SM}_b< 0.54 \, ,
\end{align}
%
which are stronger than the fits to the inclusive Higgs production cross sections. 
These upper bounds are found to be stronger than the expected due to an under-fluctuation of the data in the first $p_T$ bin. 
The bounds from the  rapidity distribution are found to be weaker. 
The sensitivities expected for Run II  are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HiggsDistFuture}.

CMS interpreted the 13\,\UTeV Higgs $p_T$ spectrum with luminosity of $35.9\,$fb$^{-1}$ to obtain bounds on the $c$ and $b$ Yukawa couplings~\cite{Sirunyan:2018sgc}. 
The resulting 95\,\% CL intervals are
%
\begin{align}
    -4.9 < \kappa_c <4.8 \, ,  \qquad
    -1.1 < \kappa_b < 1.1 \, ,
\end{align}
if the branching fractions  depend on $\kappa_b$ and $\kappa_c$. In case the branching fractions are allowed to float freely the results are
\begin{align}
    -33 < \kappa_c < 38 \, , \qquad
    -8.5 < \kappa_b < 18 \, .
\end{align}
%
The former bound on the $c$ Yukawa is stronger than the bound from the global fit of the 8\,\UTeV Higgs data along with the electroweak precision data, allowing all Higgs couplings to float~\cite{Perez:2015aoa}. However, it relies on strong assumptions that the Higgs couplings (besides $c$ or $b$) are SM like, and it is mostly sensitive to the cross section and not to the angular shape as the latter bound.

These bounds on the $c$ Yukawa are weaker\,(stronger) then the bounds from the global fit of the 8\,\UTeV Higgs data along with the electroweak precision data allowing all Higgs coupling to float~\cite{Perez:2015aoa}  

In the following these constraints on Higgs boson couplings obtained in Ref.~\cite{Sirunyan:2018sgc} are projected to an integrated luminosity of $3000$fb$^{-1}$,
%Projections for the simultaneous fits of $\kappa_c$ and $\kappa_b$ as well as $\kappa_t$  
using the expected differential distributions at $3000$fb$^{1}$ 
presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:diffxs} and detailed in Ref.~\cite{CMS-PAS-FTR-18-011}.



The Higgs boson coupling fits are based on a combination of $p_T$
distributions from the $\hgg$~\cite{Sirunyan:2018kta} decay channels
obtained at $\sqrt{s}=13\,$\UTeV.
% 
Furthermore, a search for the Higgs boson produced with large \pt and decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark ($\bb$) pair, which enhances the sensitivity at high $\pth$, is included in the $\kappat/\cg$ fit.
% 
The Higgs boson coupling fits are performed using an simultaneous extended maximum likelihood fit to the di-photon mass, four-lepton mass, and soft-drop mass $\msd$~\cite{Dasgupta:2013ihk,Larkoski:2014wba} spectra in all the analysis categories of the $\hgg$, $\hzz$, and $\hbb$ channels, respectively.
% 
For more details on the treatment of the input measurements, see Ref.~\cite{Sirunyan:2018kta}.



The treatment of the decay of the Higgs boson affects the Higgs boson coupling fits.
% 
Assuming full knowledge of how the Higgs decays, \ie assuming no beyond-the-SM contributions, the inclusive Higgs production cross section adds a strong constraint on the Higgs boson couplings in the fit.
% 
This result is obtained by parametrising the branching fractions as functions of the Higgs boson couplings.
% 
Likewise, the constraints on the Higgs boson couplings excluding the information from the inclusive cross section are of interest in order to evaluate the discriminating power of the differential distributions.
% 
This result is implemented by letting the branching fractions be determined in the fit without any prior constraint.



The expected one and two standard deviation contours of the $\kappac/\kappab$ fit with the branching fractions \hyphenation{parametrized} as functions of the Higgs boson couplings at a projected integrated luminosity of $3000$\fbinv is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:kbkc_couplingdependentBRs}, for both scenarios of systematic uncertainty.
% 
For the $\hgg$ channel the systematic uncertainties dominate if kept at the current level (\ie in Scenario 1), but when scaled down according to the Scenario 2 prescription the systematic uncertainties are within the same order of magnitude as the statistical ones.



The same fits, but now with the branching fractions implemented as nuisance parameters with no prior constraint, are shown in \ref{fig:kbkc_floatingBRs}.
% 
As this fit is dominated by statistical uncertainties even at very high integrated luminosities, the smaller systematic uncertainties in Scenario 2 have only a minor impact.

\asubsubsection{$W^\pm h$ charge asymmetry}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The $W^\pm h$ charge asymmetry, introduced in~\cite{Yu:2016rvv}, is a
new, production-based probe for constraining the light quark Yukawa
couplings.  In contrast to decay-based probes, which rely on rare or
sub-dominant Higgs decay modes, production-based probes can take
advantage of the dominant Higgs decays with high signal-to-background
ratios.  

The main observable is the charge asymmetry between $W^+ h$ and $W^-$
production,
%
\begin{align}
	A 
= 	\frac{ \sigma (W^+ h) - \sigma (W^- h)}
	{\sigma (W^+ h) + \sigma (W^- h) } \, ,
\end{align}
%
In the SM, the inclusive HE-LHC charge asymmetry is expected to be $17.3\%$, while the HL-LHC charge asymmetry is expected to be $21.6\%$.  In either
case, the charge asymmetry is driven by the proton PDFs and the fact
that the dominant $W^\pm h$ production mode stems from Higgs bosons
radiating from $W^\pm$ intermediate lines, where the Yukawa-mediated
diagrams are negligible.  If the quark Yukawas are not SM-like,
however, the charge asymmetry can either increase or decrease,
depending on the overall weight of the relevant PDFs.  In particular,
the charge asymmetry will increase if the down or up quark Yukawa
couplings are large, reflecting the increased asymmetry of $u \bar{d}$
vs.~$\bar{u} d$ PDFs; the charge asymmetry will decrease if the
strange or charm Yukawa couplings are large, reflecting the symmetric
nature of $c \bar{s}$ vs.~$\bar{c} s$ PDFs.  The sub-leading correction
from the Cabibbo angle-suppressed PDF contributions determines the
asymptotic behaviour for extremely large Yukawa enhancements.

\begin{figure}[tb!]

   27 \UTeV HE-LHC (solid coloured bands), and 14 \UTeV HL-LHC (dotted
   coloured bands), calculated at NLO QCD from MadGraph\_aMC@NLO using
   NNPDF 2.3 as a function of individual Yukawa rescaling factors
   $\bar{\kappa}_f$ for $f = u$ (red), $d$ (green), $s$ (blue), and
   $c$ (purple).  Shaded bands correspond to scale uncertainties at
   $1\sigma$ from individual $\sigma(W^+ h)$ and $\sigma(W^- h)$
   production, which are conservatively taken to be fully
   uncorrelated.  The expected statistical errors from this
   measurement using 10 ab$^{-1}$ of HE-LHC data and 3 ab$^{-1}$ of
   HL-LHC data are also shown.}
  \label{fig:asymmetry}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The effect of individual $d$, $u$, $s$, or $c$ quark Yukawa
enhancements on the inclusive charge asymmetry is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:asymmetry}, in units of $\bar{\kappa}_f = y_f /
y_{\text{SM, b}}$, evaluated at the Higgs mass scale.  Since $W^\pm h$
production probes lower Bjorken-$x$ at the HE-LHC compared to the
HL-LHC, the expected SM charge asymmetry is lower at the higher energy
collider.  In Figure~\ref{fig:asymmetry}, we also display the expected
$0.45\%$ statistical sensitivity to the charge asymmetry coming from
an HL-LHC simulation study~\cite{Yu:2016rvv} in the $W^\pm h \to
\ell^\pm \ell^\pm jj \nu \nu$ final state.  To estimate the HE-LHC
sensitivity, we simply rescale by the appropriate luminosity ratio,
giving $0.25\%$, since we expect that the increase in both signal and
background electroweak rates to largely cancel.  We also indicate the
constraint from the direct Higgs width constraint using Run I data
from CMS~\cite{Yu:2016rvv}.  The bands denote the change in the charge
asymmetry from the varying the renormalisation  and factorisation
scales within a factor of 2.

We see that the expected statistical sensitivity supersedes the
combined theoretical uncertainty in the PDF evaluation.  Hence, in
addition to being an important consistency check of the SM regarding
enhanced light quark Yukawa couplings, the charge asymmetry
measurement in different Higgs channels can be used to help determine
PDFs at the HE-LHC, assuming light quark Yukawa couplings are SM-like.
Separately, enhanced light quark Yukawa couplings would also generally
be expected to decrease the Higgs signal strengths, necessitating the
introduction of other new physics to be consistent with current Higgs
measurements~\cite{Yu:2016rvv}.  If the signal strengths are fixed to
SM expectation and the central prediction is used, the HE-LHC charge
asymmetry measurement could constrain $\bar{\kappa}_f \lesssim 2-3$
for up and charm quarks, and $\bar{\kappa}_f \lesssim 7$ for down or
strange quarks.

The CP-violating flavor conserving Yukawa couplings, $\tilde \kappa_{f_i}$, can be directly probed at the HL-LHC. Here we focus on the $\tau$ and top phases, assuming that the low energy constrained can be avoided. 
At low energy, the different flavor diagonal CP violating coupling are bounded by EDMs~\cite{Brod:2013cka,Chien:2015xha,Altmannshofer:2015qra,Brod:2018pli}. 
% beyond the Higgs contributions.
For the electron Yukawa, the latest ACME measurement~\cite{Baron:2013eja,Andreev:2018ayy} results into an upper bound of $\tilde\kappa_e<1.9\times 10^{-3}$~\cite{Altmannshofer:2015qra}. Whereas for the bottom and charm Yukawas, the strongest limits come from the neutron EDM~\cite{Brod:2018pli}. Using the NLO QCD theoretical prediction, this translates into the upper bounds $\tilde\kappa_b<5$ and $\tilde\kappa_c<21$ when theory errors are taken into account.
For the light quark CPV Yukawas, measurement of the Mercury EDM places a strong bound on the up and down Yukawas of $\tilde\kappa_u<0.1$ and $\tilde\kappa_d<0.05$~\cite{Brod:2018xyz} (no theory errors) while the neutron EDM measurement gives a weaker constraint on the strange quark Yukawa of $\tilde\kappa_s<3.1$~\cite{Brod:2018xyz} (no theory errors).






\asubsubsection{$t\bar{t} h$}

CP violation in the top quark-Higgs coupling is strongly constrained by EDM measurements and Higgs rate measurements~\cite{Brod:2013cka}. However, these constraints assume that the light quark Yukawa couplings and $hWW$ couplings have their SM values. If this is not the case, the constraints the phase of the top Yukawa coupling relax.
    
Assuming the EDM and Higgs rate  constraints can be avoided, the CP structure of the top quark Yukawa can be probed directly in $pp \to t\bar t h$. Many simple observables, such as $m_{t\bar t h}$ and $p_{T,h}$ are sensitive to the CP structure, but require reconstructing the top quarks and Higgs.

Some $t\bar t h$ observables have been proposed recently that access the CP structure without requiring full event reconstruction. These include the azimuthal angle between the two leptons in a fully leptonic $t\bar{t}$ decay with the additional requirement that the $p_{T,h} > 200\, \text{\UGeV}$~\cite{Buckley:2015vsa}, and the angle between the leptons (again in a fully leptonic $t/\bar t$ system) projected onto the plane perpendicular to the $h$ momentum~\cite{Boudjema:2015nda}. These observables only require that the Higgs is reconstructed and are inspired by the sensitivity of $\Delta \phi_{\ell^+\ell^-}$ to top/anti-top spin correlations in $pp \to t\bar t$~\cite{Mahlon:1995zn}. The sensitivity of both of these observables improves at higher Higgs boost (and therefore higher energy), making them promising targets for the HE-LHC, though no dedicated studies have been carried out to date.

Departures from the SM top quark Yukawa interactions with the Higgs boson can be considered by including a $CP$-odd component in the effective Lagrangian, i.e., ${\cal L}_{tth}=y_t\bar t (\cos\alpha+i\gamma_5\sin\alpha)t h$. The pure CP-even (CP-odd) coupling can be recovered by setting $\cos\alpha=1$ ($\cos\alpha=0$). Samples of $t\bar t h$($h\rightarrow b\bar{b}$) events were generated at the LHC for $\sqrt{s}=13$~\UTeV, with {\sc MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}, for several mixing angles, using the \texttt{HC\_NLO\_X0} model~\cite{Artoisenet:2013puc}. All relevant SM background processes were also generated using {\sc MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}. The analyses of the $t\bar t h$ ($h\rightarrow b\bar b$) events were carried out in the di-leptonic and semi-leptonic decay channels of the $t\bar t$ system. Delphes~\cite{deFavereau:2013fsa} was used for a parametrised detector simulation and both analyses used kinematic fits to fully reconstruct the $t\bar t h$ system. The results were extrapolated, as a function of luminosity, up to the full luminosity expected at the HL-LHC (3000~fb$^{-1}$).

Figure \ref{dilep} (\ref{semilep}) shows the expected CL, assuming the SM, for exclusion of the pure CP-odd scenario, as a function of the integrated luminosity, using the di-leptonic (semi-leptonic) analysis only. 
The CL were obtained using a di-leptonic (semi-leptonic) signal-enriched region containing events with at least 4 jets and 3 $b$-tagged jets (with 6 to 8 jets and 3 or 4 $b$-tagged jets) in which a likelihood ratio was computed from binned distributions of various discriminant observables~\cite{AmorDosSantos:2017ayi,Azevedo:2017qiz,Demartin:2014fia}. 
Only statistical uncertainties were considered. Figure \ref{combination} shows CL obtained from the combination of different observables in each channel i.e., $\Delta\eta(\ell^+,\ell^-)$, $\Delta\phi(t,\bar t)$ and $\sin(\theta^{t\bar tH}_{t})\sin(\theta^{H}_{W^+})$ in the di-leptonic channel and, $b_4$ and $\sin(\theta^{t\bar tH}_{\bar t})\sin(\theta^{H}_{b_H})$ in the semi-leptonic channel. The combination of the two channels is also shown for comparison. The observables were treated as uncorrelated. Figure \ref{cosaScan} shows a comparison between the CL obtained in the di-leptonic analysis alone, for the exclusion of several values of $\cos\alpha$ (between 0 and 1), taking $\Delta\eta(\ell^+,\ell^-)$ as discriminant variable.

The main conclusions of these studies can be summarised in what follows: i) many angular observables (Fig.~\ref{dilep} and Fig.~\ref{semilep}) are available with the potential of discriminating between different mixing-angles ($\cos\alpha$) in the top quark Yukawa coupling; ii) the sensitivity of the semi-leptonic final state of $t\bar{t}h$~($h\rightarrow b\bar{b}$) is higher than the di-leptonic channel alone, which requires roughly five times more luminosity for the same confidence level (Fig.~\ref{combination}); iii) the combination of the semi-leptonic and di-leptonic channels improves visibly the sensitivity with respect to the di-leptonic channel, providing a powerful test of the top quark-Higgs interactions in the fermionic sector.


\asubsubsection{$\tau\bar{\tau} h$}

The most promising direct probe of CP violation in fermionic Higgs
decays is the $\tau^+ \tau^-$ decay channel, which benefits from a
relatively large $\tau$ Yukawa giving a SM branching fraction of
$6.3\%$. Measuring the CP violating phase in the tau Yukawa requires a measurement of the linear polarisations of both $\tau$ leptons and and the azimuthal angle between them. This can be done by analysing tau substructure, namely the angular distribution of the various components of the tau decay products.

The main $\tau$ decay modes studied include $\tau^\pm \to
\rho^\pm (770) \nu$, $\rho^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$~\cite{Bower:2002zx,
  Desch:2003mw, Desch:2003rw, Harnik:2013aja, Askew:2015mda,
  Jozefowicz:2016kvz} and $\tau^\pm \to \pi^\pm
\nu$~\cite{Berge:2008wi, Berge:2008dr, Berge:2011ij}.  Assuming CPT
symmetry, collider observables for CP violation must be built from
differential distributions based on triple products of three-vectors.
In the first case, $h \to \pi^\pm \pi^0 \pi^\mp \pi^0 \nu \nu$,
angular distributions built only from the outgoing charged and neutral
pions are used to determine the CP properties of the initial $\tau$
Yukawa coupling.  In the second case, $h \to \pi^\pm \pi^\mp \nu \nu$,
there are not enough reconstructible independent momenta to construct an observable sensitive to CP violation, requiring additional kinematic information such as the $\tau$ decay impact parameter.

In the kinematic limit when each outgoing neutrino is taken to be
collinear with its corresponding reconstructed $\rho^\pm$ meson, the
acoplanarity angle, denoted $\Phi$, between the two decay planes
spanned by the $\rho^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$ decay products is exactly
analogous to the familiar acoplanarity angle from $h \to 4 \ell$
CP-property studies.  Hence, by measuring the $\tau$ decay products in
the single-prong final state, suppressing the irreudicible $Z \to
\tau^+ \tau^-$ and reducible QCD backgrounds, and reconstructing the
acoplanarity angle of $\rho^+$ vs.~$\rho^-$, the differential
distribution in $\Phi$ gives a sinusoidal shape whose maxima and
minima correspond to the CP-phase in the $\tau$ Yukawa coupling.  

An optimal observable using the collinear approximation was derived in~\cite{Harnik:2013aja}. Assuming 70\% efficiency for tagging hadronic $\tau$ final states, and
neglecting detector effects, the estimated sensitivity for the
CP-violating phase of the $\tau$ Yukawa coupling using 3 ab$^{-1}$ at
the HL-LHC is 8.0$^\circ$.  A more sophisticated
analysis~\cite{Askew:2015mda} found that detector resolution effects
on the missing transverse energy distribution degrade the expected
sensitivity considerably, and as such, about 1 ab$^{-1}$ is required
to distinguish a pure scalar coupling (CP phase is zero) from a pure
pseudoscalar coupling (CP phase is $\pi/2$).

A study on the prospect for the measurement of the $\mathcal{CP}$ state of the Higgs boson in its couplings to $\tau$ leptons has been conducted considering 3000~fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s}=14$ \UTeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2019-008}. This study investigates the sensitivity for such measurement utilising the $H\to\tau\tau$ decays where both $\tau$ leptons decay via $\tau^{\pm}\to\rho^{\pm}\nu\tau\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^0\nu_\tau$. These decays have a large branching ratio (25\%) and offer a simple way to construct an observable that is sensitive to the $\mathcal{CP}$-violating phase $\phi_\tau$. Such observable is the acoplanarity angle $\varphi ^*_{\mathcal{CP}}$~\cite{Desch:2003rw}, that is the angle between the $\tau$ decay planes that are spanned by each pion pair in the frame where the vectorial sum of the pion momenta is vanishing. The distribution of $\varphi ^*_{\mathcal{CP}}$ is expected to have sinusoidal shape with a phase that varies linearly with $\phi_\tau$. However, in order to observe such modulation, events need to be categorised based on the sign of the product of the asymmetries $y_{\pm} = (E_{\pm}-E_0)/(E_{\pm}+E_0)$ of the energies of the pions from each $\tau$ decay. In fact, events with opposite $y_{+}y_{-}$ have modulations shifted by $\pi$ in phase.

This study is based on the measurement of the $H\tau\tau$ coupling with 36.1~$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=13$ \UTeV data \cite{Aaboud:2018pen} and on an extrapolation of this measurement to the HL-LHC scenario~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2018-054}. The same selections on the hadronically decaying $\tau$ leptons and on the di-$\tau$ events are applied as in the 13~\UTeV measurement. This assumes that at the HL-LHC the online and offline selections on the hadronically decaying $\tau$ leptons will be similar to those applied during the LHC Run-2~\cite{Collaboration:2285584}. Optimisations of the event selection for the higher centre-of-mass energy, the exclusive $\tau$ decay of interest, and the detector effects impacting on the resolution of the observable $\varphi ^*_{\mathcal{CP}}$ have not been investigated, but are expected to improve the sensitivity. 

The performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector~\cite{Collaboration:2285585} has been evaluated with Gaussian smearings of the particle momenta simulated at particle level.
The precision in measuring the direction of the $\pi^{0}$ four-vector is taken to be the same as in Ref.~\cite{Aad:2015unr}. HL-LHC simulation studies show that the $\pi^{0}$ $p_{T}$ and directional resolutions in correctly reconstructed decays, do not degrade in pileup of $<\mu>\sim200$ by more than a few percent compared to Run-1. However, scenarios with worse resolutions are also considered, since this resolution is expected to have a leading effect on the precision of the $\varphi ^*_{\mathcal{CP}}$ reconstruction.
The uncertainties include only the statistical uncertainties of the expected data sample.

This study shows that even with $\pi^{0}$ resolutions 1.5 times as large as in the LHC Run-2, the pseudoscalar hypothesis could be excluded at $2\sigma$ analysing only the $H\to\tau\tau$ decays where both $\tau$ leptons decay via $\tau^{\pm}\to\rho^{\pm}\nu\tau\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^0\nu_\tau$ (about $6\%$ of the $H\to\tau\tau$ events). The $\mathcal{CP}$-violating phase could be measured at 68.3\% confidence level within $\pm 18^{\circ}$ and $\pm 33^{\circ}$ assuming the nominal or a twice as large $\pi^{0}$ resolution, respectively. Higher sensitivities are expected when more $\tau$ decays are included.

At the HE-LHC, the increased signal cross section for Higgs production
is counterbalanced by the increased background rates, and so the main
expectation is that improvements in sensitivity will be driven by the
increased luminosity and more optimised experimental methodology.
Rescaling with the appropriate luminosity factors, the optimistic
sensitivity to the $\tau$ Yukawa phase from acoplanarity studies is
4-5$^\circ$, while the more conservative estimate is roughly an order
of magnitude worse.
